Richard wrote a post encouraging voting. I think this is a big issue because rep is the basis of our &quot;economy&quot;, encourages (good) user activity, sorts out our content and makes the site look active. In particular **Question Votes** make the site look more active.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I cannot state this strongly enough.  Voting is *absolutely critical* to the formation of a healthy SE site.  And this is never more true than in Private and early Public beta.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Vote on Questions&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Voting allows the community to determine what topics are allowed and what are not.  Voting shows what constitutes a well-formed question and what is unacceptable for this community.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If you need help formulating better questions, the blog post [Asking Better Questions](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/asking-better-questions/) might help you out.  (Admittedly, it's geared towards the Stackoverflow crowd, but the philosophies there will help).  Also, [How to Ask](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-ask) directly from StackOverflow is an excellent resource.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;Finally, I want to reiterate that **Voting on questions  is free!**  It doesn't cost you any reputation to to vote a question down.  (Compared to answers:)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Vote on Answers&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Voting on answers allows a dramatic increase in reputation.  Like questions, it shows that you believe and support the answer provided.  Also, vote answers up that you think are well worded and support the answer given.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; *You don't have to agree with an answer to vote it up!*&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; To show that this is true, they've even created a [badge for voting up competing answers (called &quot;Sportsmanship&quot;)](http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/badges/63/sportsmanship).&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;If you think an answer is *useful*, vote it up.  If you think an answer is *not useful*, vote it down.  Either way, **vote**!&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If you need help on writing answers, the meta post [How do I write a good answer to a question?](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/7656/how-do-i-write-a-good-answer-to-a-question) will help you out.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Final thoughts&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If people do not vote, there won't be enough reputation on this site for it to be promoted.  Reputation is very important to a StackExchange site as it creates the groups of people capable of maintaining the site.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; To show how critical it is, Jeff Atwood posted a blog article regarding this topic: [Vote Early, Vote Often](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/vote-early-vote-often/)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Encourage others to vote!&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Quoting RobertCartaino from chat:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &gt; Vote, vote, vote. Encourage others to vote, vote, vote. On good content, leave signposts (&quot;If you like this, please vote it up. It's important for the community!&quot;)-- in both meta and the main site. Maybe a few meta posts informing the users of the important of that type of participation. You are empowered a lot more than you know.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Don't upvote bad content (edit/suggest how to fix it instead) but make sure you remember to vote, especially for questions; if you learned something from an answer on a question, the question's probably worth an upvote too so others can find the good information.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [![https://blog.stackexchange.com/images/wordpress/vote-here.jpg][1]]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://blog.stackexchange.com/images/wordpress/vote-here.jpg" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Sometimes that involves not going to what they directly wrote, because sometimes that's not the most effective way to go about it. For much the same as there are people who can't use alternatives, there are people who didn't *think* about the alternative options in the first place. It's very easy when some askers run into a problem, to tunnel-vision that &quot;I must solve it this way&quot; and then someone provides a very enlightening view by working outside the box the asker had situated inside. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, this is also part of the very nature as to why these sites permit more than one answer to a question. It is to allow different routes to solve the same problem. Some will be the direct route that is asked, others will take shortcuts as they see fit.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It remains though that naturally, sometimes an alternative, be it a particular one or just in general, is not permissible. When this is the case, that kind of a restriction is *part of the problem*. As such if the asker can't work with a given alternative, and if the only answers they're getting is that alternative, it's to them to modify their question to exclude that alternative as an option. Or if it is a known quantity to begin with, a pre-emptitive exclusion present in the question when asked is very appropriate. On the other side, if a reader happens upon a question and cannot utilize the alternatives that exist there, then they are welcome to recreate the question in a fashion which excludes the alternatives since their situation cannot cater to it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sans such an explicit exclusion, if the asker can work with the alternative, or if they still receive other answers that do not employ that alternative, there's no foul going on as a result. It's fine to dislike something being provided as an alternative, but it's by no means something we're going to discourage on a level to the point of flagging. Downvotes, those are yours to give as you see fit to things that you believe are not helpful - I could say something like &quot;It's probably more appropriate to downvote if a particular alternative is actively unhelpful to you, as opposed to a post which you stumble across in random browsing which just *happens* to be an alternative&quot;, but at the same vein, you could still deem it unhelpful and the vote is yours to cast.

I wrote in [a comment](http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/103/is-it-legal-to-make-a-weapon-with-a-3d-printer#comment123_1030)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I agree with @TomvanderZanden; a good case could be made for keeping this here. Laws and regulations can be a huge influence on an industry; the allowance or ban of certain products of said industry would seem to be relevant here. Remember, questions can be on-topic on multiple sites.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Regulatory measures can be extraordinarily important in a industry. If we had a site about making socks, should questions about whether or not is is legal to make socks with material X in the United States be off topic? I would argue no; this could be an important part of sock-making.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We have the same situation here. Some [tag:legal] questions can be important; I would argue that questions regarding which materials and devices are legal should be ones we aim for. The legality of Filament A could be really important to a project.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's not to say that all [tag:legal] questions are fine. As has been said, some of the ones we've had so far haven't been great, and I would advocate sending them to Law. But I strongly disagree that just because of the examples we've seen we should not allow [tag:legal] questions. There are good ones out there; we haven't seen their full extent yet."

But when I started 3D-printing, that's certainly where a large part of my questions lay. It's because the materials are DIFFERENT than ones we're used to dealing with, and if it weren't for 3D-printing, I wouldn't have been working with them then. It's BECAUSE I was 3D-printing that the questions arose. There are certainly similarities between the materials used for 3D-printing and other materials we might run into, but there are also vast differences. For example, ABS is the same plastic that we know from Legos. But how does working with the plastic that's been 3D-printed differ from working with a Lego? I would consider any question about that area to be valid. You mention drilling plastic, but then got the answer wrong. It is NOT like drilling wood; the way you drill plastic should be different from how you deal with wood, such as the speeds used and the use of hand drills. There are even special plastic bits that you can buy that make it easier to drill plastic. Good questions might be: for PLA, ABS and other 3dpg plastics, when is it appropriate to use such bits and when can you get away with using high speed drill bits like you would use for wood? Are higher drill speeds better than lower speeds for some 3D-printed plastics and not others, or vice versa?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In summary, I feel that questions about a technique or material that is being used in the 3D-printing process, or dealing with the materials afterward, should be valid because 3D-printing changes how the techniques are done or the materials are dealt with."

They draw in experts to answer them and they set a good example for how new questions should be framed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, close early, close often, and comment with the information needed to get the question re-opened.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.robotics.stackexchange.com/a/177/37&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://meta.3dprinting.stackexchange.com/a/112/63&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Perhaps even suggest a means to fix the errant condition(s).&#xD;&#xA; - If, after at least 24 hours of the comment, the OP has not either responded reasonably (within SE etiquette) nor updated the question, then begin the process of closing.&lt;/s&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'll leave this open to the community for amendments below:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://meta.3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/6/what-should-our-documentation-contain?rq=1&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://meta.3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/111/closing-locking-too-many-questions/112#114" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

I personally find the structure of the StackExchange sites easy to navigate and appreciate the amount of moderation that goes into each site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Search Engines#&#xD;&#xA;Most traffic will most likely come from search engines (ie Google, Yahoo, etc.) which can find the questions/answers easiest from the use of Tags here on StackExchange.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, the first thing to keep in mind is ensuring the tags you use are plenty and accurate with each question you ask. This will help increase the chances of a search engine showing your question higher in its results list.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another factor, with regard to search engines, is the title of the question. Generally people are going to be more attracted to a specific question as they feel it will answer their question better. For example:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;***Extruder keeps jamming*** as a question title will probably not attract users to view the question as it is very vague.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;***MakerBot Replicator extruder jams with new filament*** as a question title is more specific and contains more &quot;keywords&quot; that a search engine can find. Obviously, this can also potentially deter certain users (say Ultimaker users), but the hope is that the tag system will help offset this issue.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Etiquette#&#xD;&#xA;I agree with you in that I also find it difficult to &quot;advertise&quot; the 3D printing community on other websites. As it may be considered improper etiquette here on the StackExchange network to advertise or promote other websites, I wouldn't recommend &quot;advertising&quot; the community as a whole. However, if you notice, many answers on the StackExchange network include links to other forum or Q&amp;A sites (ie MSDN, CodeProject, etc.). With this in mind, I personally feel that it is appropriate to post links to specific questions here on the 3D Printing community on another site if it can benefit the users on the other site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you are wanting to personally focus on bringing more traffic, you could participate on some of the forums you mentioned and try providing relevant links to this community. But, in the interest of maintaining quality on both websites, please remain respectful and courteous.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;Hopefully this helps" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

The folks here will work hard to curate this collection of knowledge, so when someone finally finds this site through search, the last thing we want to do is send them *elsewhere* to find that information.

The problem is that Stack Exchange isn't meant to be a search engine or a list of links. We have Google for that. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Our role in making the Internet a better place is in curating a high-quality collection of crowd-sourced knowledge. Stack Exchange rates very highly among search engines, so when someone clicks through thinking they finally found an answer from a highly-trusted source, **we have a responsibility *not* to purport having information we do not.** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; sometimes it's better to accept not-perfect-answer than leave the man with no answer at all&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's a well-meaning consideration, but it ignores the purpose of curating this content as a whole. You may help that *one* person in the minimal possible sense&amp;hellip; but for the hundreds (sometimes *thousands*) of people who come after, all we did was create yet **another barrier** between the user and the information they were searching for.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That does not make the Internet better.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Redirecting users elsewhere can also displace folks who may have posted a *proper* answer. Few people are actually privy to these meta discussions and what makes these Stack Exchange sites &quot;work&quot;, so oftentimes users looking on will largely consider the issue *resolved.* Folks mostly emulate the practices and methods they see, so if cutting and pasting a link serves as an answer, then *everyone* can do it. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And in that vein, please do not answer questions in comments. Comments do not have the voting and the wiki-style editing features which allow us to properly vet and improve this content. And comments sit very prominently right there below the question, so they appear before even the *best* answers which are supposed to rise to the top. " ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Basically, a question should identify precise requirements, in order of importance, that the software should have. I think neither of the example questions achieve this, since they basically boil down to &quot;I want to model an X&quot; but give no indication of what features they need from the software, what operating system it should run on, what their budget is,...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Are the current questions acceptable?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Should we adopt SR's guidelines?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Should we disallow &quot;recommendation&quot;-questions altogether?"

The OP wants to buy a 3D printer that can be used for printing dental implants. I believe this question has two possible types of answers:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. **Highly subjective:** &quot;Printers made by MkrBot are much better than PtrBot, get the first (...)&quot;&#xD;&#xA;2. **Informational objective:** &quot;Get a resin based printer because they typically have better resolution than FDM printers (...)&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While the first is almost entirely opinion based, the second can offer some proper insight that will help the OP in search for a specific printer. In these cases, I suggest that we try to guide the OP into formulating their question such that they promote answers of the the second type, rather than the first.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/2708/what-better-3d-printer-for-dental-applications" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Winter Bash is an annual event that can run on any Stack Exchange site that chooses to participate. Users have fun by earning “hats” for their gravatars by completing certain tasks (very similar to badges). We track everyone’s progress using hats in a leaderboard that looks similar to this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [![hats][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; As always, we’re coming up with new hat designs for this year’s fun!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **The Details**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The event will run from 19 December 2016 up to and including 08 January 2017. Users will be able to see all the hats they’ve earned on http://winterbash2016.stackexchange.com. That site will also have a landing page, explaining the rules and other details of the event. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Individual users who don’t want to participate, don’t want to see hats, and/or are generally anti-hat will have an “I hate hats” option available. And just like last time, at the end of the event, all hats will go back into storage. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The only visual change to the Stack Exchange sites themselves will be the presence of the hats and the “I hate hats” button in the footer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://stackpromos.com/promos/16/winter-bash-2015&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/OohHZ.jpg" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

The more visitors we accrue, the easier it may become to reach some of these smaller goals such as ***questions per day*** and ***user reputation***. Remember that the home page for 3D Printing has sharing links to social media sites.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are a growing number of 3D printing sites such as Thingiverse, 3D Hubs, MakeXYZ, Shapeways, etc. All of these sites have avid users and I'm sure many of them have questions on a regular basis and are more than happy to share their knowledge with other Makers/Professionals.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Let's increase our Votes!##&#xD;&#xA;The more people we have visiting the site, the more **opportunity** we have have gaining more reputation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As Josip Ivic states in a recent [Meta post][2], asking/answering questions becomes a chore if people don't feel that they're efforts are appreciated or good enough. Often times there is legitimate research going into answering certain questions, so there can be real work going into providing people with quality answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The same goes for asking questions. If you've been in the same predicament or appreciate a well written question, give the question an up-vote.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Meta Activity##&#xD;&#xA;I think it is also important for everyone to occasionally review the latest here on Meta. It's a great tool for people to express how they feel the site could be better!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/82438/3d-printing&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://meta.3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/196/remember-to-vote" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Most of my questions/answers have received votes, whereas on other (nameless) sites, I have posted a number of questions/answers and not received [m]any votes at all. However, this must be my (inaccurate) perception, as the stats shows that the voting is not at the desired levels.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While it is important to votes and vote often, it is worth remembering that we shouldn't just vote willy-nilly. I have noticed that some beta sites, especially in the early days, tend to get rather frenzied (or, if you will, overly enthusiastic) voting, which one does not necessarily see in the more established sites, where the voting has settled down and only the (oft mentioned) *awesome* answers are voted for. This overly enthusiastic voting can *sometimes* end up giving random votes to questions that are not particularly researched, or answers that are not fully accurate, which maybe do not deserve any votes at all.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am not sure why this (comparatively) frenzied voting occurs, or why it dies down, nor am I sure what (which?) level of voting is appropriate - although it is obvious that poorly researched questions and inaccurate answers should not be voted up. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Regardless, I would agree that voting *does* act as an incentive to contribute to the site, as well as the idea that voting for a good question, or accurate answer, even if that question/answer does not apply directly to you, because it will help other users.

Something like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Hello @[UserName], I noticed your question has been up for a while now. Have any of the answers below been able to solve your question? If so, would you mind accepting the appropriate answer. If not, what is missing so that we may help you further?

Richard wrote a post encouraging voting. I think this is a big issue because rep is the basis of our &quot;economy&quot;, encourages (good) user activity, sorts out our content and makes the site look active. In particular **Question Votes** make the site look more active.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I cannot state this strongly enough.  Voting is *absolutely critical* to the formation of a healthy SE site.  And this is never more true than in Private and early Public beta.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Vote on Questions&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Voting allows the community to determine what topics are allowed and what are not.  Voting shows what constitutes a well-formed question and what is unacceptable for this community.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If you need help formulating better questions, the blog post [Asking Better Questions](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/asking-better-questions/) might help you out.  (Admittedly, it's geared towards the Stackoverflow crowd, but the philosophies there will help).  Also, [How to Ask](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-ask) directly from StackOverflow is an excellent resource.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;Finally, I want to reiterate that **Voting on questions  is free!**  It doesn't cost you any reputation to to vote a question down.  (Compared to answers:)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Vote on Answers&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Voting on answers allows a dramatic increase in reputation.  Like questions, it shows that you believe and support the answer provided.  Also, vote answers up that you think are well worded and support the answer given.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; *You don't have to agree with an answer to vote it up!*&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; To show that this is true, they've even created a [badge for voting up competing answers (called &quot;Sportsmanship&quot;)](http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/badges/63/sportsmanship).&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;If you think an answer is *useful*, vote it up.  If you think an answer is *not useful*, vote it down.  Either way, **vote**!&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If you need help on writing answers, the meta post [How do I write a good answer to a question?](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/7656/how-do-i-write-a-good-answer-to-a-question) will help you out.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Final thoughts&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If people do not vote, there won't be enough reputation on this site for it to be promoted.  Reputation is very important to a StackExchange site as it creates the groups of people capable of maintaining the site.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; To show how critical it is, Jeff Atwood posted a blog article regarding this topic: [Vote Early, Vote Often](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/vote-early-vote-often/)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Encourage others to vote!&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Quoting RobertCartaino from chat:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &gt; Vote, vote, vote. Encourage others to vote, vote, vote. On good content, leave signposts (&quot;If you like this, please vote it up. It's important for the community!&quot;)-- in both meta and the main site. Maybe a few meta posts informing the users of the important of that type of participation. You are empowered a lot more than you know.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Don't upvote bad content (edit/suggest how to fix it instead) but make sure you remember to vote, especially for questions; if you learned something from an answer on a question, the question's probably worth an upvote too so others can find the good information.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [![https://blog.stackexchange.com/images/wordpress/vote-here.jpg][1]]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://blog.stackexchange.com/images/wordpress/vote-here.jpg" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Richard wrote a post encouraging voting. I think this is a big issue because rep is the basis of our &quot;economy&quot;, encourages (good) user activity, sorts out our content and makes the site look active. In particular **Question Votes** make the site look more active.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I cannot state this strongly enough.  Voting is *absolutely critical* to the formation of a healthy SE site.  And this is never more true than in Private and early Public beta.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Vote on Questions&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Voting allows the community to determine what topics are allowed and what are not.  Voting shows what constitutes a well-formed question and what is unacceptable for this community.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If you need help formulating better questions, the blog post [Asking Better Questions](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/asking-better-questions/) might help you out.  (Admittedly, it's geared towards the Stackoverflow crowd, but the philosophies there will help).  Also, [How to Ask](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-ask) directly from StackOverflow is an excellent resource.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;Finally, I want to reiterate that **Voting on questions  is free!**  It doesn't cost you any reputation to to vote a question down.  (Compared to answers:)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Vote on Answers&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Voting on answers allows a dramatic increase in reputation.  Like questions, it shows that you believe and support the answer provided.  Also, vote answers up that you think are well worded and support the answer given.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; *You don't have to agree with an answer to vote it up!*&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; To show that this is true, they've even created a [badge for voting up competing answers (called &quot;Sportsmanship&quot;)](http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/badges/63/sportsmanship).&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;If you think an answer is *useful*, vote it up.  If you think an answer is *not useful*, vote it down.  Either way, **vote**!&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If you need help on writing answers, the meta post [How do I write a good answer to a question?](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/7656/how-do-i-write-a-good-answer-to-a-question) will help you out.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Final thoughts&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If people do not vote, there won't be enough reputation on this site for it to be promoted.  Reputation is very important to a StackExchange site as it creates the groups of people capable of maintaining the site.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; To show how critical it is, Jeff Atwood posted a blog article regarding this topic: [Vote Early, Vote Often](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/vote-early-vote-often/)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Encourage others to vote!&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Quoting RobertCartaino from chat:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &gt; Vote, vote, vote. Encourage others to vote, vote, vote. On good content, leave signposts (&quot;If you like this, please vote it up. It's important for the community!&quot;)-- in both meta and the main site. Maybe a few meta posts informing the users of the important of that type of participation. You are empowered a lot more than you know.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Don't upvote bad content (edit/suggest how to fix it instead) but make sure you remember to vote, especially for questions; if you learned something from an answer on a question, the question's probably worth an upvote too so others can find the good information.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [![https://blog.stackexchange.com/images/wordpress/vote-here.jpg][1]]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://blog.stackexchange.com/images/wordpress/vote-here.jpg" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Richard wrote a post encouraging voting. I think this is a big issue because rep is the basis of our &quot;economy&quot;, encourages (good) user activity, sorts out our content and makes the site look active. In particular **Question Votes** make the site look more active.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I cannot state this strongly enough.  Voting is *absolutely critical* to the formation of a healthy SE site.  And this is never more true than in Private and early Public beta.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Vote on Questions&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Voting allows the community to determine what topics are allowed and what are not.  Voting shows what constitutes a well-formed question and what is unacceptable for this community.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If you need help formulating better questions, the blog post [Asking Better Questions](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/asking-better-questions/) might help you out.  (Admittedly, it's geared towards the Stackoverflow crowd, but the philosophies there will help).  Also, [How to Ask](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-ask) directly from StackOverflow is an excellent resource.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;Finally, I want to reiterate that **Voting on questions  is free!**  It doesn't cost you any reputation to to vote a question down.  (Compared to answers:)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Vote on Answers&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Voting on answers allows a dramatic increase in reputation.  Like questions, it shows that you believe and support the answer provided.  Also, vote answers up that you think are well worded and support the answer given.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; *You don't have to agree with an answer to vote it up!*&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; To show that this is true, they've even created a [badge for voting up competing answers (called &quot;Sportsmanship&quot;)](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/badges/63/sportsmanship).&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;If you think an answer is *useful*, vote it up.  If you think an answer is *not useful*, vote it down.  Either way, **vote**!&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If you need help on writing answers, the meta post [How do I write a good answer to a question?](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/7656/how-do-i-write-a-good-answer-to-a-question) will help you out.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Final thoughts&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If people do not vote, there won't be enough reputation on this site for it to be promoted.  Reputation is very important to a StackExchange site as it creates the groups of people capable of maintaining the site.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; To show how critical it is, Jeff Atwood posted a blog article regarding this topic: [Vote Early, Vote Often](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/vote-early-vote-often/)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Encourage others to vote!&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Quoting RobertCartaino from chat:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &gt; Vote, vote, vote. Encourage others to vote, vote, vote. On good content, leave signposts (&quot;If you like this, please vote it up. It's important for the community!&quot;)-- in both meta and the main site. Maybe a few meta posts informing the users of the important of that type of participation. You are empowered a lot more than you know.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Don't upvote bad content (edit/suggest how to fix it instead) but make sure you remember to vote, especially for questions; if you learned something from an answer on a question, the question's probably worth an upvote too so others can find the good information.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [![https://blog.stackexchange.com/images/wordpress/vote-here.jpg][1]]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://blog.stackexchange.com/images/wordpress/vote-here.jpg" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

There were some issues when HSM sprang up, because Mathematics, Physics, and other sites allowed history-related questions. I participated in several meta discussions on these sites. While Physics eventually decided to not allow history questions, Mathematics and other sites continued to allow them. So we should not make our decision based on Law.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I do agree that, so far, the [tag:legal] questions have not been great. But in the future, they could be. I wrote in [a comment](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/103/is-it-legal-to-make-a-weapon-with-a-3d-printer#comment123_1030)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I agree with @TomvanderZanden; a good case could be made for keeping this here. Laws and regulations can be a huge influence on an industry; the allowance or ban of certain products of said industry would seem to be relevant here. Remember, questions can be on-topic on multiple sites.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Regulatory measures can be extraordinarily important in a industry. If we had a site about making socks, should questions about whether or not is is legal to make socks with material X in the United States be off topic? I would argue no; this could be an important part of sock-making.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We have the same situation here. Some [tag:legal] questions can be important; I would argue that questions regarding which materials and devices are legal should be ones we aim for. The legality of Filament A could be really important to a project.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's not to say that all [tag:legal] questions are fine. As has been said, some of the ones we've had so far haven't been great, and I would advocate sending them to Law. But I strongly disagree that just because of the examples we've seen we should not allow [tag:legal] questions. There are good ones out there; we haven't seen their full extent yet."

Richard wrote a post encouraging voting. I think this is a big issue because rep is the basis of our &quot;economy&quot;, encourages (good) user activity, sorts out our content and makes the site look active. In particular **Question Votes** make the site look more active.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I cannot state this strongly enough.  Voting is *absolutely critical* to the formation of a healthy SE site.  And this is never more true than in Private and early Public beta.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Vote on Questions&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Voting allows the community to determine what topics are allowed and what are not.  Voting shows what constitutes a well-formed question and what is unacceptable for this community.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If you need help formulating better questions, the blog post [Asking Better Questions](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/asking-better-questions/) might help you out.  (Admittedly, it's geared towards the Stackoverflow crowd, but the philosophies there will help).  Also, [How to Ask](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-ask) directly from StackOverflow is an excellent resource.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;Finally, I want to reiterate that **Voting on questions  is free!**  It doesn't cost you any reputation to to vote a question down.  (Compared to answers:)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Vote on Answers&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Voting on answers allows a dramatic increase in reputation.  Like questions, it shows that you believe and support the answer provided.  Also, vote answers up that you think are well worded and support the answer given.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; *You don't have to agree with an answer to vote it up!*&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; To show that this is true, they've even created a [badge for voting up competing answers (called &quot;Sportsmanship&quot;)](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/badges/63/sportsmanship).&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;If you think an answer is *useful*, vote it up.  If you think an answer is *not useful*, vote it down.  Either way, **vote**!&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If you need help on writing answers, the meta post [How do I write a good answer to a question?](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/7656/how-do-i-write-a-good-answer-to-a-question) will help you out.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Final thoughts&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If people do not vote, there won't be enough reputation on this site for it to be promoted.  Reputation is very important to a StackExchange site as it creates the groups of people capable of maintaining the site.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; To show how critical it is, Jeff Atwood posted a blog article regarding this topic: [Vote Early, Vote Often](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/vote-early-vote-often/)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ###Encourage others to vote!&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Quoting RobertCartaino from chat:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &gt; Vote, vote, vote. Encourage others to vote, vote, vote. On good content, leave signposts (&quot;If you like this, please vote it up. It's important for the community!&quot;)-- in both meta and the main site. Maybe a few meta posts informing the users of the important of that type of participation. You are empowered a lot more than you know.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Don't upvote bad content (edit/suggest how to fix it instead) but make sure you remember to vote, especially for questions; if you learned something from an answer on a question, the question's probably worth an upvote too so others can find the good information.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; [![https://blog.stackexchange.com/images/wordpress/vote-here.jpg][1]]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://blog.stackexchange.com/images/wordpress/vote-here.jpg" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

Given the results of steps #2 and #3, think about a rough idea of a schedule for the blog. Will there be one post a week, posted Mondays? Will there be posts on Tuesdays and posts on Fridays? You don’t need to be pushing out posts daily, but you should post at least once a week.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*and*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Pick a posting schedule and stick to it**. It is easier to simply keep up from the get go than catch up if you fall behind.  Have a couple draft posts stashed away for a rainy day, ready to go that can be published if there is a lull.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, who would coordinate it? Are you putting yourself forward?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Have someone holding the reins**. This person doesn’t need to be the one writing all the posts, just someone that helps coordinate who is writing what and when it is getting posted.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, it *is* a bit of a misfortune that Blog Overflow has a rather unfortunately acronym (as well as sounding like *Bog* Overflow).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://gr33nonline.wordpress.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://stackoverflow.blog/2011/06/23/blog-overflow/" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 3.0" />

I'm currently using insights I obtained from mucking about with a 3D printer with Arduino Mega 2560 and RAMPS 1.4 to dive into retrofitting an elderly CNC router (but, as a router, still, not as a printer) with a new control system (presently thinking and have on order Arduino Uno R3 and Arduino CNC shield R3, we'll see how implementation goes on those) and was wondering if I could ask questions here that would overlap, or not, as I don't think there's a CNC/subtractive community similar to this 3DP/additive one in the ecosystem yet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I actually started out thinking I could just use the same controller setup (there's plenty of stepper driver slots available, and going &quot;dual-purpose&quot; cut and print is potentially interesting) but it seems the official GRBL fork is not 2560 compatible, though there is a fork to try and make it so - it seemed more of a sure bet to stick with the &quot;official&quot; fork and the common hardware.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Likewise I've seen a bit of chatter about making Marlin switch-hit CNC/3DP, but I get the impression it's not all there yet, and I'm more interested in immediately usable based on current/past efforts than trying to develop new functionality my dang self."

Electronics, SE.Engineering, SE.Hardware Recommendations, etc. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Admittedly, there will be overlap with some other SE sites and whilst we need to avoid the *too-broad-black-hole*, we should also welcome all things that are 3D Printer related, so as to keep all relevant knowledge in a central location.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Additional suggestions in the future&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of posting a new question, it *might* be a good idea to post an additional answer, containing the suggestion, to this question - in order to keep everything grouped together.

If I get time, I might add a new section to the meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/276, for some select closed questions.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;***One thing that I did see was that the closed questions, also seem to get automatically deleted. This is a shame because some of them have interesting/informative answers. So this raises the question that whilst, yeah, close the obvious shopping answers, should the associated information/knowledge that resides in the answers be lost, or not displayed, because the question was auto-deleted? Is there a close-but-don't-delete flag?***&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have been browsing a number of [closed questions][1] and came across a lot of &quot;Best first printer&quot; type questions, which are off-topic, admittedly, but they had some good answers. I think those sorts of questions get people to want to answer, for whatever reason (pride/emotion in demonstrating their own first printer, good/bad experiences, what have you...). Maybe, instead of closing *all* of them, it is worth having just one example (locked/wiki) question, such as the example below, so that it *has already* been asked - then we can legitimately close subsequent similar duplicates, without any loss of information or help.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Taking this one as an example, https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/5836/whats-the-least-amount-of-money-i-can-spend-to-get-a-decent-printer. It was closed as being too broad. I actually voted to close it as well, although I'm starting to wish that I hadn't. It has some great answers in it and it is a shame that they have been lost.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since having been closed, it has now been *automatically deleted*. I'm just wondering whether it is worth undeleting it..?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am not 100% sure whether, after undeleting it, then leaving it closed will cause it to be automatically deleted again - isn't there some sort of *closed-but-don't-delete* flag? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If there isn't then would it also have to be re-opened? Which, of course, entails other issues of &quot;Why do we allow certain broad questions to be left open?&quot; or &quot;It's a shopping question!&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Regardless, it *does* seem a shame to have lost those fine (but subjective) answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/search?q=closed%3Ayes" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

It is merely an attempt to offer one perspective of what has been suggested, and to ask &quot;How should we move forward?&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes it is a bit hard to see the wood for the trees...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Following on from tjb1's meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134/post-closing-issues, it seems like we should widen the scope and be less strict about what is, and what is not, on-topic. What do people think? What additions, if any, should be made? Are there things that definitely should be on the list, that aren't currently?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, with respect to our [On-topic page][1], which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking (&quot;why has my question been closed?&quot;/&quot;why is X not allowed&quot;),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words &quot;[ask][2]&quot; and &quot;[topic][3]&quot;. I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request. The full list is at the bottom of this post.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even though I went through both lists twice - also, I didn't read *every* question and answer listed below fully - *there may be some suggestions that I have missed*. Please feel free to either suggest a change, or edit this post directly and add any that have gone astray (in that respect, maybe this question should be a wiki?).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Whilst we maybe don't want to change the aim of the site too much (as doing so may put off some regular users), maybe the scope needs to broaden slightly, as to have a wider appeal and be more *inclusive*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Any thoughts, questions, additional suggestions that have not already been posted, agreements, or disagreements?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###TL;DR - Suggested topics&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the list below, &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Italics are used for notes&#xD;&#xA; - Strikethrough is used for definitive no-go topics&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Whilst there may be *some* overlap, duplication and/or mis-categorisation, the list of suggested on-topics seems to be, essentially:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Recommendations (Hardware and Software)&#xD;&#xA;   - *Note: Usually banned from SE - with the exception of [Hardware Recommendations][4]*&#xD;&#xA;   - &lt;strike&gt;General Shopping  - *opinion based*&lt;/strike&gt;&#xD;&#xA;   - &lt;strike&gt;First printer - *opinion based*&lt;/strike&gt;, *see https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/278/best-first-printer-closed-wiki*&#xD;&#xA;   - Best printer&#xD;&#xA;     - &lt;strike&gt;Overall - *opinion based*&lt;/strike&gt;&#xD;&#xA;     - For specific task  - *opinion based but allowable?*&#xD;&#xA;   - Best software&#xD;&#xA;     - &lt;strike&gt;Overall - *opinion based*&lt;/strike&gt;&#xD;&#xA;     - For a specific task  - *opinion based but allowable?*&#xD;&#xA; - Software issues&#xD;&#xA;   - Firmware&#xD;&#xA;   - Tools &#xD;&#xA;   - 3D modelling (*same as **CAD**?*)&#xD;&#xA; - Websites (*could come under **Software** and/or **Tools***)&#xD;&#xA;   - Recommended sites&#xD;&#xA;     - for knowledge&#xD;&#xA;     - for models&#xD;&#xA;     - for online tools&#xD;&#xA;   - Issues with web based tools&#xD;&#xA; - CAD&#xD;&#xA;   - *Overlap with SE.Blender?*&#xD;&#xA; - Printer DIY&#xD;&#xA;   - Repair and maintenance (*both commercial and DIY repair of both commercial and DIY printers*)&#xD;&#xA;   - Construction&#xD;&#xA; - Components (*could come under **Printer DIY***)&#xD;&#xA;   - *[Thermistors][5] is a good example, see note below*&#xD;&#xA; - Print Services&#xD;&#xA; - Scanning&#xD;&#xA;   - Also 3D Reconstruction ([example][6])&#xD;&#xA; - Bio-printing&#xD;&#xA; - Models&#xD;&#xA;   - Feasibility&#xD;&#xA;   - Availability&#xD;&#xA; - Sharing recommended settings&#xD;&#xA; - Legal issues&#xD;&#xA;   - Copyright (i.e. [Lego][7])&#xD;&#xA;   - Guns/Weapons&#xD;&#xA;   - Insurance (i.e. fire damage)&#xD;&#xA; - Filament&#xD;&#xA; - Makerspaces&#xD;&#xA; - Non-3D Printing related&#xD;&#xA;   - CNC&#xD;&#xA;   - Laser&#xD;&#xA;   - Routers&#xD;&#xA;   - Vacuum Forming&#xD;&#xA;   - Parts assembly ([example][8])&#xD;&#xA; - Misc&#xD;&#xA;   - Not strictly 3D related, see **Non-3D Printing related** above&#xD;&#xA;   - Anything 3D related&#xD;&#xA;     - *For example, [connecting 3D printed parts][9] is currently off-topic*&#xD;&#xA;   - Other&#xD;&#xA;     - FFF&#xD;&#xA;     - FDM&#xD;&#xA;     - SLA&#xD;&#xA;     - DLP&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Notes**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;WRT **Components**, and taking the [thermistors meta question][10] as an example, my first thought is that questions like this should remain, as they are pertinent to 3D Printing, otherwise we *could* theoretically end up compartmentalising printers and migrating off a lot of stuff to SE. Electronics, SE.Engineering, SE.Hardware Recommendations, etc. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The same applies to the **Misc/Anything 3D related**, in particular the [*Connecting 3D parts* question][9]. Yes, as some of the comments state, you could remove the 3D printer part and then it is basically an engineering question. However, when taken as a whole, this question *is* pertinent to 3D printing of large models, in parts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Admittedly, there will be overlap with some other SE sites and whilst we need to avoid the *too-broad-black-hole*, we should also welcome all things that are 3D Printer related, so as to keep all relevant knowledge in a central location.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Additional suggestions in the future&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of posting a new question, it *might* be a good idea to post an additional answer, containing the suggestion, to this question - in order to keep everything grouped together. This will save on the pain of having to go through all of the Meta questions as I have just done.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, that might mean that the suggestion request would not have such prominence that it would do if the suggestion was posted independently as its own question... So (at the risk of duplication), if a new question/suggestion is posted, then it could be a good idea to also copy that new post and add it as an answer below.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Meta Suggestions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are the meta questions that I used to create the categories above:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## [ask](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=ask) - 89 questions *in total*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###General scope questions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;

It is merely an attempt to offer one perspective of what has been suggested, and to ask &quot;How should we move forward?&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes it is a bit hard to see the wood for the trees...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Following on from tjb1's meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134/post-closing-issues, it seems like we should widen the scope and be less strict about what is, and what is not, on-topic. What do people think? What additions, if any, should be made? Are there things that definitely should be on the list, that aren't currently?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, with respect to our [On-topic page][1], which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking (&quot;why has my question been closed?&quot;/&quot;why is X not allowed&quot;),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words &quot;[ask][2]&quot; and &quot;[topic][3]&quot;. I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request. The full list is at the bottom of this post.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even though I went through both lists twice - also, I didn't read *every* question and answer listed below fully - *there may be some suggestions that I have missed*.

Electronics, SE.Engineering, SE.Hardware Recommendations, etc. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The same applies to the **Misc/Anything 3D related**, in particular the [*Connecting 3D parts* question][9]. Yes, as some of the comments state, you could remove the 3D printer part and then it is basically an engineering question. However, when taken as a whole, this question *is* pertinent to 3D printing of large models, in parts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Also under **Misc/Anything 3D related**, Coding CURA *is* a SO type question, but it is *also* 3D printer specific&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Additional suggestions in the future&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of posting a new question, it *might* be a good idea to post an additional answer, containing the suggestion, to this question - in order to keep everything grouped together. This will save on the pain of having to go through all of the Meta questions as I have just done.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, that might mean that the suggestion request would not have such prominence that it would do if the suggestion was posted independently as its own question... So (at the risk of duplication), if a new question/suggestion is posted, then it could be a good idea to also copy that new post and add it as an answer below.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Meta Suggestions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are the meta questions that I used to create the categories above:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## [ask](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=ask) - 89 questions *in total*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###General scope questions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;

Which, of course, entails other issues of &quot;Why do we allow certain broad questions to be left open?&quot; or &quot;It's a shopping question!&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Regardless, it *does* seem a shame to have lost those fine (but subjective) answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Summing up&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, the point of this post is, should we save this information somewhere, and if so, in what format?

This is a shame because some of them have interesting/informative answers.

I think those sorts of questions get people to want to answer, for whatever reason (pride/emotion in demonstrating their own first printer, good/bad experiences, what have you...). Maybe, instead of closing *all* of them, it is worth having just one example question, such as the example below, so that it *has already* been asked - then we can legitimately close subsequent similar duplicates, without any loss of information or help.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Taking this one as an example, https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/5836/whats-the-least-amount-of-money-i-can-spend-to-get-a-decent-printer.

It is merely an attempt to offer one perspective of what has been suggested, and to ask &quot;How should we move forward?&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes it is a bit hard to see the wood for the trees...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Following on from tjb1's meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134/post-closing-issues, it seems like we should widen the scope and be less strict about what is, and what is not, on-topic. What do people think? What additions, if any, should be made? Are there things that definitely should be on the list, that aren't currently?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, with respect to our [On-topic page][1], which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking (&quot;why has my question been closed?&quot;/&quot;why is X not allowed&quot;),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words &quot;[ask][2]&quot; and &quot;[topic][3]&quot;. I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request.

Electronics, SE.Engineering, SE.Hardware Recommendations, etc. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The same applies to the **Misc/Anything 3D related**, in particular the [*Connecting 3D parts* question][9]. Yes, as some of the comments state, you could remove the 3D printer part and then it is basically an engineering question.

It is merely an attempt to offer one perspective of what has been suggested, and to ask &quot;How should we move forward?&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes it is a bit hard to see the wood for the trees...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Following on from tjb1's meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134/post-closing-issues, it seems like we should widen the scope and be less strict about what is, and what is not, on-topic. What do people think? What additions, if any, should be made? Are there things that definitely should be on the list, that aren't currently?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, with respect to our [On-topic page][1], which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking (&quot;why has my question been closed?&quot;/&quot;why is X not allowed&quot;),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words &quot;[ask][2]&quot; and &quot;[topic][3]&quot;. I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request. The full list is at the bottom of this post.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even though I went through both lists twice - also, I didn't read *every* question and answer listed below fully - *there may be some suggestions that I have missed*.

Electronics, SE.Engineering, SE.Hardware Recommendations, etc. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The same applies to the **Misc/Anything 3D related**, in particular the [*Connecting 3D parts* question][10]. Yes, as some of the comments state, you could remove the 3D printer part and then it is basically an engineering question. However, when taken as a whole, this question *is* pertinent to 3D printing of large models, in parts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Also under **Misc/Anything 3D related**, Coding CURA *is* a SO type question, but it is *also* 3D printer specific&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Additional suggestions in the future&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of posting a new question, it *might* be a good idea to post an additional answer, containing the suggestion, to this question - in order to keep everything grouped together.

SE 3D Printing is quite a small site and there aren't an awful lot of regulars here - but there are just enough who can give great answers, but not everyone ventures here, into meta. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think that you *should* ask the question, it does seem on-topic. If it is well presented (without typos) and has the necessary detail, then it should be OK.  It is usually only very poorly worded, poorly formatted and overly broad questions, where little thought and research has been done beforehand, which are shot down in flames... :-) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Looking at your Reddit post, it seems ok, but it could be worth relevant quoting parts from those links that you listed (as links die over time and the information that you refer to could be lost), and show why or why not, *you* think certain options may or may not be suitable. Your question could also appear to be opinion-based or broad - so it could be better to narrow down your question to a point or two (or three).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If it **does** end up getting closed, which hopefully it won't as you do appear to have put some thought into it, you will be provided with guidance as to how to edit and improve it and make it more suitable for StackExchange.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I wouldn't worry too much, even the best of us have *bad post days* sometimes... it's not a big deal :-)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, think about it this way, the time that you take formulating and crafting your question will be well spent as it should help clarify your question in your own mind.

As Jon Ericson pointed out to Mechanics.SE before we graduated and were asking the same question asked here, he stated:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [*... voting is the engine that drives the reputation economy*](https://mechanics.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1447/4152). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think Mech had a little different scenario than does 3D Printing, but it still holds true. If you want people to show up and do things, you (and everyone else) needs to vote. Up, down, sideways ... doesn't matter. They all help drive people to *do things* in every Stack.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Looking at the above link, you can see one of the things which is important to graduation is having the right user base. You have to have people who have the ability to do things which only those who have met the point level can do. As it stands the highest ranked person by point total is [Tom van der Zanden](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/users/26/tom-van-der-zanden). He hasn't (as of this writing) broached 10k points. There are two users who have more than 5k points, and another five who are over 2500. How do you improve this scenario? You guessed it, by voting. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I realize with sub two questions per day (QPD), there's not a lot to vote on. That can be overcome as well. Those of you who have had issues or have met challenges have knowledge. Write down those challenges you've faced in a question. Then, either write an answer for them, or let someone else figure them out. Either way, you are creating opportunity for the site to expand. That opportunity will be giving someone a chance to vote and/or answer the question. Plus, you are doing what SE wants done in the first place: *bringing and recording knowledge*. It's a win-win.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There's a ton of other things which can be done to get 3D Printing graduated. I'm sure we'll get there sooner or later. I hope I can help in some small way. I'm not the bastion of all knowledge to get a site graduated, that's for sure, but having gone through it with Mechanics gives me some insight.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here's to the future and what it will bring."

It is merely an attempt to offer one perspective of what has been suggested, and to ask &quot;How should we move forward?&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes it is a bit hard to see the wood for the trees...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Following on from tjb1's meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134/post-closing-issues, it seems like we should widen the scope and be less strict about what is, and what is not, on-topic. What do people think? What additions, if any, should be made? Are there things that definitely should be on the list, that aren't currently?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, with respect to our [On-topic page][1], which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking (&quot;why has my question been closed?&quot;/&quot;why is X not allowed&quot;),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words &quot;[ask][2]&quot; and &quot;[topic][3]&quot;. I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request. The full list is at the bottom of this post.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even though I went through both lists twice - also, I didn't read *every* question and answer listed below fully - *there may be some suggestions that I have missed*.

Electronics, SE.Engineering, SE.Hardware Recommendations, etc. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The same applies to the **Misc/Anything 3D related**, in particular the [*Connecting 3D parts* question][10]. Yes, as some of the comments state, you could remove the 3D printer part and then it is basically an engineering question. However, when taken as a whole, this question *is* pertinent to 3D printing of large models, in parts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Also under **Misc/Anything 3D related**, Coding CURA *is* a SO type question, but it is *also* 3D printer specific&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Additional suggestions in the future&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of posting a new question, it *might* be a good idea to post an additional answer, containing the suggestion, to this question - in order to keep everything grouped together. This will save on the pain of having to go through all of the Meta questions as I have just done.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, that might mean that the suggestion request would not have such prominence that it would do if the suggestion was posted independently as its own question... So (at the risk of duplication), if a new question/suggestion is posted, then it could be a good idea to also copy that new post and add it as an answer below.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Meta Suggestions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are the meta questions that I used to create the categories above:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## [ask](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=ask) - 89 questions *in total*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###General scope questions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;

It is merely an attempt to offer one perspective of what has been suggested, and to ask &quot;How should we move forward?&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes it is a bit hard to see the wood for the trees...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Following on from tjb1's meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134/post-closing-issues, it seems like we should widen the scope and be less strict about what is, and what is not, on-topic. What do people think? What additions, if any, should be made? Are there things that definitely should be on the list, that aren't currently?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, with respect to our [On-topic page][1], which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking (&quot;why has my question been closed?&quot;/&quot;why is X not allowed&quot;),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words &quot;[ask][2]&quot; and &quot;[topic][3]&quot;. I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request.

Electronics, SE.Engineering, SE.Hardware Recommendations, etc. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The same applies to the **Misc/Anything 3D related**, in particular the [*Connecting 3D parts* question][10]. Yes, as some of the comments state, you could remove the 3D printer part and then it is basically an engineering question. However, when taken as a whole, this question *is* pertinent to 3D printing of large models, in parts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Also under **Misc/Anything 3D related**, Coding CURA *is* a SO type question, but it is *also* 3D printer specific&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Additional suggestions in the future&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of posting a new question, it *might* be a good idea to post an additional answer, containing the suggestion, to this question - in order to keep everything grouped together. This will save on the pain of having to go through all of the Meta questions as I have just done.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, that might mean that the suggestion request would not have such prominence that it would do if the suggestion was posted independently as its own question... So (at the risk of duplication), if a new question/suggestion is posted, then it could be a good idea to also copy that new post and add it as an answer below.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Meta Suggestions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are the meta questions that I used to create the categories above:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## [ask](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=ask) - 89 questions *in total*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###General scope questions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;

The opinion based, the open ended and and the *list of questions in one question*. Of these, the third is usually curable. And we had the topic of purchasind [earlier][1].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But now I want to put attention on a different horse in the room. Purchasing questions. These come actually in quite some different styles!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. &quot;I want to buy X. Where to get it?&quot;&#xD;&#xA;2. &quot;I need a model to do X but for [insert reason here] can't make it myself. Is there a model of it?&quot;&#xD;&#xA;3. &quot;I wonder about X. Has anyone encoutered X and can review it, so I can make an informed purchase?&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All these question cores can be called purchasing, but they are also different to some degree. Let's start from the least to the most concearning one:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Question 2 is more a &quot;LMGTFY&quot;. There is a clear best answer, as there might be a model around or someone might make the model for the person asking. Or convert an unprinted model into a printable one. It is somewhat OffTopic for being 3D-design in some instances, but it is OnTopic as we want a 3D printable rendition. So, no problems with these? A little: they often show little to no research effort.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Question 3 is a different kind of horse. Actually it looks more like a Mule than a horse. Well, that is, because it is actually an ass&lt;sup&gt;donkey&lt;/sup&gt;. It is not a purchasing question in so much as it is a review request. We had some review guidelines proposed when we last talked about purchasing questions, and they were a solid step, but we might - if this is still OnTopic after this discussion, make a seperate meta for those. I deem the possibility of Reviews with a strict guideline OnTopic, as long as &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. all affiliations are made clear [e.g. is it a bought machine, review/send back machine or review/keep machine? Who's the sponsor? Just a watcher of this and that channel that reviewed the machine?] &#xD;&#xA; 2. They pass a Quality Control (however that may look like - guidelines are still to be made)&#xD;&#xA; 3. **They are not link-only answers.** One might put the full review in a video or link to several reviewers, but one should at least compile the pro/con of the video.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Question 1 is the big horse I have trouble seeing OnTopic here: they want a specific answer where to buy/get an object. Suggesting that one specific source might be better than any other would be inappropriate. But we might need to split the hair a little: There are *some* fringe cases where such a question is answerable, has a best answer and is not open ended when it comes to locating shops or makerspaces, that use the very same question setup (&quot;Is there a makerspace near X/Y/Z?&quot;) And there are questions that are what the RPG-StacK-Exchange calls &quot;Shopping &amp; Recommendation&quot;. They forbid to ask for a recommendation of a specific shop or item over another. We should adhere to that, unless it is one of these &quot;locate a real world place that does X&quot; cases. Imho we shouldn't  answer to a question like &quot;What is a good first printer?&quot; or &quot;Is there a reputable CR-10 reseller?&quot; or others of these kind.

There is a clear best answer, as there might be a model around or someone might make the model for the person asking. Or convert an unprinted model into a printable one.

Well, that is, because it is actually an ass&lt;sup&gt;donkey&lt;/sup&gt;. It is not a purchasing question in so much as it is a review request.

They forbid to ask for a recommendation of a specific shop or item over another. We should adhere to that, unless it is one of these &quot;locate a real world place that does X&quot; cases.

It is merely an attempt to offer one perspective of what has been suggested, and to ask &quot;How should we move forward?&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes it is a bit hard to see the wood for the trees...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Following on from tjb1's meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134/post-closing-issues, it seems like we should widen the scope and be less strict about what is, and what is not, on-topic. What do people think? What additions, if any, should be made? Are there things that definitely should be on the list, that aren't currently?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, with respect to our [On-topic page][1], which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking (&quot;why has my question been closed?&quot;/&quot;why is X not allowed&quot;),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words &quot;[ask][2]&quot; and &quot;[topic][3]&quot;. I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request. The full list is at the bottom of this post.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even though I went through both lists twice - also, I didn't read *every* question and answer listed below fully - *there may be some suggestions that I have missed*. Please feel free to either suggest a change, or edit this post directly and add any that have gone astray (in that respect, maybe this question should be a wiki?).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Whilst we maybe don't want to change the aim of the site too much (as doing so may put off some regular users), maybe the scope needs to broaden slightly, as to have a wider appeal and be more *inclusive*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Any thoughts, questions, additional suggestions that have not already been posted, agreements, or disagreements?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###TL;DR - Suggested topics&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the list below, &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Italics are used for notes&#xD;&#xA; - Strikethrough is used for definitive no-go topics&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Whilst there may be *some* overlap, duplication and/or mis-categorisation, the list of suggested on-topics seems to be, essentially:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Recommendations (Hardware and Software)&#xD;&#xA;   - *Note: Usually banned from SE - with the exception of [Hardware Recommendations][4]*&#xD;&#xA;   - &lt;strike&gt;General Shopping  - *opinion based*&lt;/strike&gt;&#xD;&#xA;   - &lt;strike&gt;First printer - *opinion based*&lt;/strike&gt;, *see https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/278/best-first-printer-closed-wiki*&#xD;&#xA;   - Best printer&#xD;&#xA;     - &lt;strike&gt;Overall - *opinion based*&lt;/strike&gt;&#xD;&#xA;     - For specific task  - *opinion based but allowable?*&#xD;&#xA;   - Best software&#xD;&#xA;     - &lt;strike&gt;Overall - *opinion based*&lt;/strike&gt;&#xD;&#xA;     - For a specific task  - *opinion based but allowable?*&#xD;&#xA; - Software issues&#xD;&#xA;   - Firmware&#xD;&#xA;   - Tools &#xD;&#xA;   - Coding/Compiling firmware (see **Misc - Coding**)&#xD;&#xA;   - 3D modelling (*same as **CAD**?*)&#xD;&#xA; - Websites (*could come under **Software** and/or **Tools***)&#xD;&#xA;   - Recommended sites&#xD;&#xA;     - for knowledge&#xD;&#xA;     - for models&#xD;&#xA;     - for online tools&#xD;&#xA;   - Issues with web based tools&#xD;&#xA; - CAD&#xD;&#xA;   - *Overlap with SE.Blender?*&#xD;&#xA; - Printer DIY&#xD;&#xA;   - Repair and maintenance (*both commercial and DIY repair of both commercial and DIY printers*)&#xD;&#xA;   - Construction&#xD;&#xA;   - Mechatronics&#xD;&#xA; - Components (*could come under **Printer DIY***)&#xD;&#xA;   - *[Thermistors][5] is a good example, see note &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; below*&#xD;&#xA; - Print Services&#xD;&#xA; - Scanning&#xD;&#xA;   - Also 3D Reconstruction ([example][6])&#xD;&#xA; - Bio-printing&#xD;&#xA; - Models&#xD;&#xA;   - Feasibility&#xD;&#xA;   - Availability&#xD;&#xA; - Sharing recommended settings&#xD;&#xA; - Legal issues&#xD;&#xA;   - Copyright (i.e. [Lego][7])&#xD;&#xA;   - Guns/Weapons&#xD;&#xA;   - Insurance (i.e. fire damage)&#xD;&#xA; - Materials&#xD;&#xA;   - Filament&#xD;&#xA;   - ABS&#xD;&#xA;   - PLA&#xD;&#xA;   - PETG&#xD;&#xA;   - etc.&#xD;&#xA; - Makerspaces&#xD;&#xA; - Non-3D Printing related&#xD;&#xA;   - CNC&#xD;&#xA;   - Laser ([example][8])&#xD;&#xA;   - Routers&#xD;&#xA;   - Vacuum Forming&#xD;&#xA;   - Parts assembly ([example][9])&#xD;&#xA; - Misc&#xD;&#xA;   - Not strictly 3D related, see **Non-3D Printing related** above&#xD;&#xA;   - Anything 3D related&#xD;&#xA;     - Connecting 3D printed parts - *For example, [connecting 3D printed parts][10] is currently off-topic*&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;     - Coding - *For example https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/3109/how-to-build-own-cura-gui - Coding CURA question, migrated to SO*&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;   - Other&#xD;&#xA;     - FFF (fused Filament Fabrication)&#xD;&#xA;     - FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling)&#xD;&#xA;     - SLA (Stereo Lithography)&#xD;&#xA;     - DLP (Digital Light Processing)&#xD;&#xA;     - SLS (Selective Laser Sintering)&#xD;&#xA;     - DLMS (Direct Laser Metal Smelting)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Notes**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Admittedly, there will be overlap with some other SE sites and whilst we need to avoid the *too-broad-black-hole*, we should also welcome all things that are 3D Printer related, so as to keep all relevant knowledge in a central location.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; WRT **Components**, and taking the [thermistors meta question][11] as an example, my first thought is that questions like this should remain, as they are pertinent to 3D Printing, otherwise we *could* theoretically end up compartmentalising printers and migrating off a lot of stuff to SE. Electronics, SE.Engineering, SE.Hardware Recommendations, etc. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The same applies to the **Misc/Anything 3D related**, in particular the [*Connecting 3D parts* question][10]. Yes, as some of the comments state, you could remove the 3D printer part and then it is basically an engineering question. However, when taken as a whole, this question *is* pertinent to 3D printing of large models, in parts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Also under **Misc/Anything 3D related**, Coding CURA *is* a SO type question, but it is *also* 3D printer specific&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Additional suggestions in the future&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of posting a new question, it *might* be a good idea to post an additional answer, containing the suggestion, to this question - in order to keep everything grouped together. This will save on the pain of having to go through all of the Meta questions as I have just done.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, that might mean that the suggestion request would not have such prominence that it would do if the suggestion was posted independently as its own question... So (at the risk of duplication), if a new question/suggestion is posted, then it could be a good idea to also copy that new post and add it as an answer below.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Meta Suggestions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are the meta questions that I used to create the categories above:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## [ask](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=ask) - 89 questions *in total*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###General scope questions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;

It is merely an attempt to offer one perspective of what has been suggested, and to ask &quot;How should we move forward?&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes it is a bit hard to see the wood for the trees...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Following on from tjb1's meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134/post-closing-issues, it seems like we should widen the scope and be less strict about what is, and what is not, on-topic. What do people think? What additions, if any, should be made? Are there things that definitely should be on the list, that aren't currently?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, with respect to our [On-topic page][1], which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking (&quot;why has my question been closed?&quot;/&quot;why is X not allowed&quot;),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words &quot;[ask][2]&quot; and &quot;[topic][3]&quot;. I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request. The full list is at the bottom of this post.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even though I went through both lists twice - also, I didn't read *every* question and answer listed below fully - *there may be some suggestions that I have missed*. Please feel free to either suggest a change, or edit this post directly and add any that have gone astray (in that respect, maybe this question should be a wiki?).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Whilst we maybe don't want to change the aim of the site too much (as doing so may put off some regular users), maybe the scope needs to broaden slightly, as to have a wider appeal and be more *inclusive*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Any thoughts, questions, additional suggestions that have not already been posted, agreements, or disagreements?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###TL;DR - Suggested topics&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the list below, &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Italics are used for notes&#xD;&#xA; - Strikethrough is used for definitive no-go topics&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Whilst there may be *some* overlap, duplication and/or mis-categorisation, the list of suggested on-topics seems to be, essentially:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Recommendations (Hardware and Software)&#xD;&#xA;   - *Note: Usually banned from SE - with the exception of [Hardware Recommendations][4]*&#xD;&#xA;   - &lt;strike&gt;General Shopping  - *opinion based*&lt;/strike&gt;&#xD;&#xA;   - &lt;strike&gt;First printer - *opinion based*&lt;/strike&gt;, *see https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/278/best-first-printer-closed-wiki*&#xD;&#xA;   - Best printer&#xD;&#xA;     - &lt;strike&gt;Overall - *opinion based*&lt;/strike&gt;&#xD;&#xA;     - For specific task  - *opinion based but allowable?*&#xD;&#xA;   - Best software&#xD;&#xA;     - &lt;strike&gt;Overall - *opinion based*&lt;/strike&gt;&#xD;&#xA;     - For a specific task  - *opinion based but allowable?*&#xD;&#xA; - Software issues&#xD;&#xA;   - Firmware&#xD;&#xA;   - Tools &#xD;&#xA;   - Coding/Compiling firmware (see **Misc - Coding**)&#xD;&#xA;   - 3D modelling (*same as **CAD**?*)&#xD;&#xA; - Websites (*could come under **Software** and/or **Tools***)&#xD;&#xA;   - Recommended sites&#xD;&#xA;     - for knowledge&#xD;&#xA;     - for models&#xD;&#xA;     - for online tools&#xD;&#xA;   - Issues with web based tools&#xD;&#xA; - CAD&#xD;&#xA;   - *Overlap with SE.Blender?*&#xD;&#xA; - Printer DIY&#xD;&#xA;   - Repair and maintenance (*both commercial and DIY repair of both commercial and DIY printers*)&#xD;&#xA;   - Construction&#xD;&#xA;   - Mechatronics&#xD;&#xA; - Components (*could come under **Printer DIY***)&#xD;&#xA;   - *[Thermistors][5] is a good example, see note &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; below*&#xD;&#xA; - Print Services&#xD;&#xA; - Scanning&#xD;&#xA;   - Also 3D Reconstruction ([example][6])&#xD;&#xA; - Bio-printing&#xD;&#xA; - Models&#xD;&#xA;   - Feasibility&#xD;&#xA;   - Availability&#xD;&#xA; - Sharing recommended settings&#xD;&#xA; - Legal issues&#xD;&#xA;   - Copyright (i.e. [Lego][7])&#xD;&#xA;   - Guns/Weapons&#xD;&#xA;   - Insurance (i.e. fire damage)&#xD;&#xA; - Materials&#xD;&#xA;   - Filament&#xD;&#xA;   - ABS&#xD;&#xA;   - PLA&#xD;&#xA;   - PETG&#xD;&#xA;   - etc.&#xD;&#xA; - Makerspaces&#xD;&#xA; - Non-3D Printing related&#xD;&#xA;   - CNC&#xD;&#xA;   - Laser ([example][8])&#xD;&#xA;   - Routers&#xD;&#xA;   - Vacuum Forming&#xD;&#xA;   - Parts assembly ([example][9])&#xD;&#xA; - Misc&#xD;&#xA;   - Not strictly 3D related, see **Non-3D Printing related** above&#xD;&#xA;   - Anything 3D related&#xD;&#xA;     - Connecting 3D printed parts - *For example, [connecting 3D printed parts][10] is currently off-topic*&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;     - Coding - *For example https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/3109/how-to-build-own-cura-gui - Coding CURA question, migrated to SO*&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;   - Other&#xD;&#xA;     - FFF (fused Filament Fabrication)&#xD;&#xA;     - FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling)&#xD;&#xA;     - SLA (Stereo Lithography)&#xD;&#xA;     - DLP (Digital Light Processing)&#xD;&#xA;     - SLS (Selective Laser Sintering)&#xD;&#xA;     - DLMS (Direct Laser Metal Smelting)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Notes**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Admittedly, there will be overlap with some other SE sites and whilst we need to avoid the *too-broad-black-hole*, we should also welcome all things that are 3D Printer related, so as to keep all relevant knowledge in a central location.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; WRT **Components**, and taking the [thermistors meta question][11] as an example, my first thought is that questions like this should remain, as they are pertinent to 3D Printing, otherwise we *could* theoretically end up compartmentalising printers and migrating off a lot of stuff to SE. Electronics, SE.Engineering, SE.Hardware Recommendations, etc. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The same applies to the **Misc/Anything 3D related**, in particular the [*Connecting 3D parts* question][10]. Yes, as some of the comments state, you could remove the 3D printer part and then it is basically an engineering question. However, when taken as a whole, this question *is* pertinent to 3D printing of large models, in parts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Also under **Misc/Anything 3D related**, Coding CURA *is* a SO type question, but it is *also* 3D printer specific&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Additional suggestions in the future&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of posting a new question, it *might* be a good idea to post an additional answer, containing the suggestion, to this question - in order to keep everything grouped together. This will save on the pain of having to go through all of the Meta questions as I have just done.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, that might mean that the suggestion request would not have such prominence that it would do if the suggestion was posted independently as its own question... So (at the risk of duplication), if a new question/suggestion is posted, then it could be a good idea to also copy that new post and add it as an answer below.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Meta Suggestions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are the meta questions that I used to create the categories above:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## [ask](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=ask) - 89 questions *in total*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###General scope questions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;

We might need to be very specific in the tag definitions if people aren't going to get confused.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If, all four examples are DIY then fine. If none of them are, because the plastic parts were purchased, then ok, we have a *very strict* definition of DIY.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Just for completeness, the first three scenarios are my personal purchasing experiences, where I considered them as DIY printers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, to be fair to your question, I *think* I know what you mean. You are referring to printer kits from established manufacturers that are available pre-built, *or* as kits. Is that right? I just want to clarify what defines a commercial kit and a DIY kit.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Does that make sense? I might have got a bit carried away." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Are there things that definitely should be on the list, that aren't currently?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, with respect to our [On-topic page][1], which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking (&quot;why has my question been closed?&quot;/&quot;why is X not allowed&quot;),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words &quot;[ask][2]&quot; and &quot;[topic][3]&quot;. I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request.

WRT **Components**, and taking the [thermistors meta question][11] as an example, my first thought is that questions like this should remain, as they are pertinent to 3D Printing, otherwise we *could* theoretically end up compartmentalising printers and migrating off a lot of stuff to SE. Electronics, SE.Engineering, SE.Hardware Recommendations, etc. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The same applies to the **Misc/Anything 3D related**, in particular the [*Connecting 3D parts* question][10]. Yes, as some of the comments state, you could remove the 3D printer part and then it is basically an engineering question. However, when taken as a whole, this question *is* pertinent to 3D printing of large models, in parts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Also under **Misc/Anything 3D related**, Coding CURA *is* a SO type question, but it is *also* 3D printer specific&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Additional suggestions in the future&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of posting a new question, it *might* be a good idea to post an additional answer, containing the suggestion, to this question - in order to keep everything grouped together. This will save on the pain of having to go through all of the Meta questions as I have just done.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, that might mean that the suggestion request would not have such prominence that it would do if the suggestion was posted independently as its own question... So (at the risk of duplication), if a new question/suggestion is posted, then it could be a good idea to also copy that new post and add it as an answer below.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Meta Suggestions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are the meta questions that I used to create the categories above:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## [ask](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=ask) - 89 questions *in total*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###General scope questions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;

It is merely an attempt to offer one perspective of what has been suggested, and to ask &quot;How should we move forward?&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes it is a bit hard to see the wood for the trees...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Following on from tjb1's meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134/post-closing-issues, it seems like we should widen the scope and be less strict about what is, and what is not, on-topic. What do people think? What additions, if any, should be made? Are there things that definitely should be on the list, that aren't currently?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, with respect to our [On-topic page][1], which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking (&quot;why has my question been closed?&quot;/&quot;why is X not allowed&quot;),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words &quot;[ask][2]&quot; and &quot;[topic][3]&quot;. I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request. The full list is at the bottom of this post.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even though I went through both lists twice - also, I didn't read *every* question and answer listed below fully - *there may be some suggestions that I have missed*. Please feel free to either suggest a change, or edit this post directly and add any that have gone astray (in that respect, maybe this question should be a wiki?).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Whilst we maybe don't want to change the aim of the site too much (as doing so may put off some regular users), maybe the scope needs to broaden slightly, as to have a wider appeal and be more *inclusive*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Any thoughts, questions, additional suggestions that have not already been posted, agreements, or disagreements?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###TL;DR - Suggested topics&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the list below, &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Italics are used for notes&#xD;&#xA; - Strikethrough is used for definitive no-go topics&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Whilst there may be *some* overlap, duplication and/or mis-categorisation, the list of suggested on-topics seems to be, essentially:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Recommendations (Hardware and Software)&#xD;&#xA;   - *Note: Usually banned from SE - with the exception of [Hardware Recommendations][4]*&#xD;&#xA;   - &lt;strike&gt;General Shopping  - *opinion based*&lt;/strike&gt;&#xD;&#xA;

WRT **Components**, and taking the [thermistors meta question][11] as an example, my first thought is that questions like this should remain, as they are pertinent to 3D Printing, otherwise we *could* theoretically end up compartmentalising printers and migrating off a lot of stuff to SE. Electronics, SE.Engineering, SE.Hardware Recommendations, etc. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The same applies to the **Misc/Anything 3D related**, in particular the [*Connecting 3D parts* question][10]. Yes, as some of the comments state, you could remove the 3D printer part and then it is basically an engineering question. However, when taken as a whole, this question *is* pertinent to 3D printing of large models, in parts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Also under **Misc/Anything 3D related**, Coding CURA *is* a SO type question, but it is *also* 3D printer specific&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Additional suggestions in the future&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of posting a new question, it *might* be a good idea to post an additional answer, containing the suggestion, to this question - in order to keep everything grouped together. This will save on the pain of having to go through all of the Meta questions as I have just done.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, that might mean that the suggestion request would not have such prominence that it would do if the suggestion was posted independently as its own question... So (at the risk of duplication), if a new question/suggestion is posted, then it could be a good idea to also copy that new post and add it as an answer below.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Meta Suggestions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are the meta questions that I used to create the categories above:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## [ask](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=ask) - 89 questions *in total*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###General scope questions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;

If you talk to the same person regardless of which part is defective out of the box, it's not DIY.  So, from Greenonline's examples, 1, 2, and 3 are DIY, while 4 and 5 aren't.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Yes, that means that a printer can evolve from &quot;not DIY&quot; to &quot;DIY&quot;.  For example, if you start with a preassembled Prusa i3 Mk3, but then replace the V6 hotend with a Volcano hotend in an extruder found on Thingiverse, switch to a 320-watt Meanwell PSU, replace the display with a touchscreen, change out the ball bearings for sleeve bearings, upgrade the steppers for more precision, and install a BuildTak bed, you've now got a DIY printer."

If you've been on any of the `.moderated` newsgroups you'll be well aware that to get a post on there, it needs to undergo a review process first and be accepted. The aim is to keep problem discussions from arising.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;SE is slightly different - it works the other  way. *Anyone* can ask a question on SE and closing a question is the equivalent of putting that question *back into review/improve mode*. It's a feedback mechanism designed to react to problem cases only, so the usual business of asking and answering good questions can just... *happen*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why do we close a question?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The philosophy of SE is that each site handles questions on *problems you face* or things you are trying to understand. The [don't ask](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask) section of the help center gives you a good overview of things that don't work - to summarise:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Some questions invite arguments or extended debate that suck up time when members could be helping other people.&#xD;&#xA;* Some questions are too broad, too narrow or have other content problems.&#xD;&#xA;* Some questions belong elsewhere.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These have been worked out over time and with a lot of experience from Stack Overflow and are, *broadly speaking* true. Sometimes, exceptions are made - it is always a case-by-case thing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Is closing like deletion?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;No. Actually, deletion is a different concept on SE. Closed questions are put &quot;into improve mode&quot; if you like, and are still visible for *anyone* to improve. That's the idea. Deleted questions are different — they have a red background and are invisible to all but high reputation users. So deletion is different and solves a slightly different problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### What are the requirements for closing a question?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you have 3000 reputation, or 500 reputation on a beta site, you can vote to close any question for the reasons above. More on that in a moment.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you do not have this level of reputation, you will find that under the flag menu, you have an option &quot;this question does not belong here&quot;. That will raise a flag for users who can vote to close.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why can anyone vote to close/reopen?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Firstly, anyone with sufficient reputation can vote to close or reopen (or flag as such, with lower reputation) because it is *your site*. This is really important - it's about expressing what you feel works and doesn't.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Ok, so how does it work?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Example close button][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ok, the important piece. Voting to close works like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * Underneath the question, there will be a close link. When you click on this, you will be presented with a list of options from which you can pick a close reason most appropriate to the situation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Close vote reasons dialog][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * If other people have voted, you will see blue numbers against the reason they chose.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Other votes][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; * The exact duplicate page takes you to a page that allows you to specify a question to close as an exact duplicate against.&#xD;&#xA; * The &quot;off topic&quot; page will present you with two options - one to migrate here, to meta, and one just off topic. At the moment, only moderators can send questions elsewhere, so feel free to cast a vote here and flag if you have a target in mind - we are collecting statistics to build a &quot;migrate to&quot; list, but that is not implemented yet.&#xD;&#xA; * The other options are straight out closes.&#xD;&#xA; * Once you pick your option and click &quot;close&quot;, your vote is registered. You cannot retract it at this stage, but nobody else, including moderators, will know it was you who voted.&#xD;&#xA; * If five people agree, the question will be closed. You've seen the effect of these before.&#xD;&#xA; * Your name, and the name of other closers, will appear on the bottom of the question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Close banner][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### How does vote to re-open work?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A closed question has a &quot;reopen&quot; link underneath it. If you click this, a dialog box will ask you if you are sure - click yes and your vote will be registered to re-open the question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Below, you can see an example of the re-open link with two votes registered for re-opening (out of five).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Re-open link][5]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### What happens if I make a mistake?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Don't worry! You can retract your close vote by clicking the “close” button again. This is useful, for example, if the question has been edited since you voted to close. Note that you cannot use this to change the close reason (if you retract a close vote, you can't cast a new one).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Furthermore, unless five people agree, or a moderator agrees, the question won't be closed. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Why are some questions closed with fewer votes?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Moderator close votes complete the required vote count immediately, no matter how many people have voted. This applies for both close/reopen votes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Furthermore, closure as duplicate can be faster for two reasons. If the asker agrees that their question is a duplicate, they can validate the closure immediately. This shows a final duplicate close vote from “Community”. Also, if a user with a gold tag badge in one of the question's initial tags votes to close or reopen as a duplicate, this takes effect immediately; in this case a gold tag badge icon appears after the closer's name.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### I've seen a closed question and I disagree. What can I do?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Well, one option is to use your re-open vote! You can also always raise a discussion here on meta to seek clarification on why a question is closed and hopefully either a resolution will be reached, or you will get an explanation for the closure. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### My name appears on the bottom. Isn't this going to cause problems with other users?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Actually, surprisingly few closed questions generate any response at all.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, if you experience difficulties as a result of closing a question, you can and should contact a moderator via the flag mechanism (which is anonymous). We can then take any necessary action.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### How do I find questions I might need to close? What about re-opens?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the [review queues](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/review), specifically the [close votes queue](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/review/close) and the [reopen votes queue](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/review/reopen). These queues are open to everyone who has the close vote privilege. For each question, you get to decide whether to close/reopen or not; enough “no” votes take the question out of the queue. An edit from the queue is a vote to not close or reopen.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/qogGL.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/THms0.png&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/69Kak.png&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/K3F4V.png&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/syw4O.png" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

(1) Comments do not show up in searches, (2) Your answer may help someone else (3) As we are a beta site we *really* need to keep the number of unanswered questions to a minimum, if we are to continue as a site (4) You will earn more reputation from votes and accepting your answer.

I don't think this site lends to having a huge amount of ApQ's, because usually there is only going to really be one answer which will work. I think the ApQ category was based more towards the programming/tech sites. I mean, when programming, there's almost ALWAYS going to be more than one way to answer a question.Then when you look at other sites where there is advice given, like Travel.SE or Law.SE, you could possibly see a plethora of answers for each of their questions. Then you take WorldBuilding.SE and it's a whole new level.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;IIRC, when Mechanics.SE graduated, we had sub 2.0 ApQ. I don't think 3D's is out of line with that and it isn't going to hurt the site for graduation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While multi-ApQ is not a bad thing, it only works if the question deserves it. If the question isn't answered correctly or if there might be something else which could be the answer, then multi-ApQ is an awesome thing. To make answers for answer sake, just to boost the ApQ, that can be ugly. A much better idea is (IMHO), to upvote good Q/A's and downvote bad ones.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I completely agree with moving the site forward, but my suggestion is to move it forward in the right direction by putting energy where energy is needed. &#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

That can't be right, surely? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The stats can be seen here, [3D Printing Area51 site][2]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Stats progress#&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - *Questions per day* **2.1** -&gt; &lt;strike&gt;1.9&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;strike&gt;1.6&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;strike&gt;2.1&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;strike&gt;2.7&lt;/strike&gt; 2.1&#xD;&#xA; - *Answer rate* **96%** -&gt; &lt;strike&gt;93%&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;strike&gt;95%&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;strike&gt;96%&lt;/strike&gt; 97%&#xD;&#xA; - *Users*&#xD;&#xA;  - *200+ reputation* **56**/150 -&gt; &lt;strike&gt;103/150&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;strike&gt;113/150&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;strike&gt;139/150&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;strike&gt;144/150&lt;/strike&gt; 151/150&#xD;&#xA;  - *2,000+ reputation* **4**/10 -&gt; &lt;strike&gt;8/10&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;strike&gt;9/10&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;strike&gt;10/10&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;strike&gt;11/10&lt;/strike&gt; 12/10&#xD;&#xA;  - *3,000+ reputation* **3**/5 -&gt; &lt;strike&gt;4/5&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;strike&gt;6/5&lt;/strike&gt; 7/5&#xD;&#xA; - *Answers per question* ratio is **2.0** -&gt; 1.9&#xD;&#xA; - *visits per day* **753**  -&gt; &lt;strike&gt;4&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;strike&gt;2,324&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;strike&gt;2648&lt;/strike&gt; &lt;strike&gt;2675&lt;/strike&gt; 2774&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Additional points of note&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The stats above aren't really the be all to end all... there are a few other considerations that I came across here, [in this answer][3], to [“Graduation” of this Community][4]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1.

A number of 3k+ users ( *n* &gt; 10 ) are required to be able to fully vote&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###The final hurdle&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The main sticking point, according to this meta post on Ethereum, [Congratulations! Ethereum is graduating!][5], is 10 questions per day, which we are a long way from, and seems to be the last remaining issue. A link ([Graduation, site closure, and a clearer outlook on the health of SE sites][6]) from the Ethereum meta post to Meta.SE states:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; When a site starts to consistently receive 10 questions/day, we’ll consider it for graduation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/197/3d-printing-se-beta-status&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/82438/3d-printing&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://robotics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1354/graduation-of-this-community/1355#1355&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://robotics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1354/graduation-of-this-community&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://ethereum.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/474/congratulations-ethereum-is-graduating&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/257614/graduation-site-closure-and-a-clearer-outlook-on-the-health-of-se-sites" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

It is easy for users to pile in on top of a downvote or close vote, and to justify this as keeping the site content of high quality. For sure, we don't want to be a repository of badly written 'fix my printer' posts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the IoT site (also in Beta, and with a fairly small core of engaged users), we made a deliberate effort to [improve questions][5] which were initially closed, once the OP had been given some time to make their own edits. This was quite an interesting challenge, since it helps in thinking what the really useful question to have asked would be. Overall, it improves the number of questions (and thus the reach of the site when it comes to organic search). It keeps the active users engaged in proposing edits, it generates more answers to be upvoted. If the OP comes back to ask another question in 6 months time (after their mini rage-quit), they might be pleasantly surprised to have gained some upvotes or answers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Clearly not all bad questions are good candidates for improvement.

PLA, ABS, PVA, etc.) which in FDM is usually the same as the print-material. However, in the case of machines like dual-extruders can be completely different. The print-material for the body of the part can be PLA while the support-material can be PVA. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Support-structure defines the &quot;style&quot; of structure that is generated by the slicer. For instance, I can have a scaffolding-like structure to support bridges and spire-like structure for small overhangs. Personally, I view infill as a subset of support-structure because it is material that is meant to support the overall body including ceilings. With infill I can have square, hexagonal, even cat-like styles of support structure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Trish - I agree on the structure being more about style (Trees, pylons, towers, included in the design or not, everywhere or not) while support material is more a subset of filament - PVA is one of those, but also one could use (in a dual extruder) ABS on a PLA print, and then remove the supports with acetone or some other stuff. One might use a super low melting filament and remove with heat." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Note that the `[help]`, `[ask]`, `[answer]` and `[about]` tags (in the C&amp;P) expand into *Help Center*, *How to Ask*, *How to Answer* and *Tour* links, respectively - so the entire URL does *not* need to be specified. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - `[help]`   =&gt; [help center][1]&#xD;&#xA; - `[ask]`    =&gt; [How to Ask][2]&#xD;&#xA; - `[answer]` =&gt; [How to Answer][3]&#xD;&#xA; - `[about]` =&gt; [tour][4]&#xD;&#xA; - `[tour]` =&gt; [tour][4]&#xD;&#xA; - `[chat]` =&gt; [3D Printing Chat][5]&#xD;&#xA; - `[edit]` =&gt; Edit the post link&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;N.B. `[tour]` and `[about]` are equivalent.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;See [comment formatting][6] for more information, or *better still*, see the [Complete list of help center magic links][7]. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also worthy of mention are *relative links*, so you can skip the *absolute URL* part (i.e. `https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com`).

It would be an excellent idea to maintain a standard comments reply list on some sort of platform (GitHub, GitLab, community wiki on meta, etc.).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that an automatic standardized comment already exists for marking a duplicate topic; the system will post a default duplicate comment message for you which you can change within 5 minutes after posting.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Where applicable, replace `&lt;username&gt;` with the actual user name of the poster being addressed*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Each standardised comment below is shown in two formats:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. As *block quotes* for readability&#xD;&#xA;2. As *code formatting*, for ease of copy and paste (**C&amp;P &amp;#x2398;**)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are four sections:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - General Comments&#xD;&#xA; - Comments&#xD;&#xA; - Questions&#xD;&#xA; - Answers&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Note on shortcuts: *Magic links* and Relative paths&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is possible to reduce the length of the comments, so that they fit, by using *shortcuts*. Note that the `[help]`, `[ask]`, `[answer]` and `[about]` tags (in the C&amp;P) expand into *Help Center*, *How to Ask*, *How to Answer* and *Tour* links, respectively - so the entire URL does *not* need to be specified. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - `[help]`   =&gt; [help center][1]&#xD;&#xA; - `[ask]`    =&gt; [How to Ask][2]&#xD;&#xA; - `[answer]` =&gt; [How to Answer][3]&#xD;&#xA; - `[about]` =&gt; [tour][4]&#xD;&#xA; - `[tour]` =&gt; [tour][4]&#xD;&#xA; - `[chat]` =&gt; [3D Printing Chat][5]&#xD;&#xA; - `[edit]` =&gt; Edit the post link&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;N.B. `[tour]` and `[about]` are equivalent.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;See [comment formatting][6] for more information, or *better still*, see the [Complete list of help center magic links][7]. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also worthy of mention are *relative links*, so you can skip the *absolute URL* part (i.e. `https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com`).

For example:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - `[Ask Question](/questions/ask)` =&gt; Ask Question link (at the top of the page)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Just copy the relative part of the URL (to the page that you want to point to) from your browser.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#General comments&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Welcome to Stack Exchange&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Please use these in conjunction with other necessary/constructive comments - not as a stand alone comment, as these tend to add *noise*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    Hi &lt;username&gt; and welcome to Stack Exchange!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;or &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    Hi &lt;username&gt; and welcome to Stack Exchange 3D Printing!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;or shorter (given the limited number of character) and more precise&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    Hi &lt;username&gt; and welcome to SE.3DPrinting!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;or even shorter&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    Hi &lt;username&gt; and welcome to SE.3DP!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;##Post to be deleted&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Unfortunately your post will be deleted, but please do not let this discourage you.

It would be an excellent idea to maintain a standard comments reply list on some sort of platform (GitHub, GitLab, community wiki on meta, etc.).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that an automatic standardized comment already exists for marking a duplicate topic; the system will post a default duplicate comment message for you which you can change within 5 minutes after posting.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Where applicable, replace `&lt;username&gt;` with the actual user name of the poster being addressed*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Each standardised comment below is shown in two formats:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. As *block quotes* for readability&#xD;&#xA;2. As *code formatting*, for ease of copy and paste (**C&amp;P &amp;#x2398;**)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are four sections:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - General Comments&#xD;&#xA; - Comments&#xD;&#xA; - Questions&#xD;&#xA; - Answers&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Note on shortcuts: *Magic links* and Relative paths&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is possible to reduce the length of the comments, so that they fit, by using *shortcuts*. Note that the `[help]`, `[ask]`, `[answer]` and `[about]` tags (in the C&amp;P) expand into *Help Center*, *How to Ask*, *How to Answer* and *Tour* links, respectively - so the entire URL does *not* need to be specified. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - `[help]`   =&gt; [help center][1]&#xD;&#xA; - `[ask]`    =&gt; [How to Ask][2]&#xD;&#xA; - `[answer]` =&gt; [How to Answer][3]&#xD;&#xA; - `[about]` =&gt; [tour][4]&#xD;&#xA; - `[tour]` =&gt; [tour][4]&#xD;&#xA; - `[chat]` =&gt; [3D Printing Chat][5]&#xD;&#xA; - `[edit]` =&gt; Edit the post link&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;N.B. `[tour]` and `[about]` are equivalent.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;See [comment formatting][6] for more information, or *better still*, see the [Complete list of help center magic links][7]. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also worthy of mention are *relative links*, so you can skip the *absolute URL* part (i.e. `https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com`). For example:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - `[Ask Question](/questions/ask)` =&gt; Ask Question link (at the top of the page)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Just copy the relative part of the URL (to the page that you want to point to) from your browser.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#General comments&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Welcome to Stack Exchange&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Please use these in conjunction with other necessary/constructive comments - not as a stand alone comment, as these tend to add *noise*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    Hi &lt;username&gt; and welcome to Stack Exchange!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;or &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    Hi &lt;username&gt; and welcome to Stack Exchange 3D Printing!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;or shorter (given the limited number of character) and more precise&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    Hi &lt;username&gt; and welcome to SE.3DPrinting!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;or even shorter&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    Hi &lt;username&gt; and welcome to SE.3DP!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;##Post to be deleted&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Unfortunately your post will be deleted, but please do not let this discourage you.

It is merely an attempt to offer one perspective of what has been suggested, and to ask &quot;How should we move forward?&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes it is a bit hard to see the wood for the trees...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Following on from tjb1's meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134/post-closing-issues, it seems like we should widen the scope and be less strict about what is, and what is not, on-topic. What do people think? What additions, if any, should be made? Are there things that definitely should be on the list, that aren't currently?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, with respect to our [On-topic page][1], which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking (&quot;why has my question been closed?&quot;/&quot;why is X not allowed&quot;),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words &quot;[ask][2]&quot; and &quot;[topic][3]&quot;. I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request. The full list is at the bottom of this post.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even though I went through both lists twice - also, I didn't read *every* question and answer listed below fully - *there may be some suggestions that I have missed*.

WRT **Components**, and taking the [thermistors meta question][11] as an example, my first thought is that questions like this should remain, as they are pertinent to 3D Printing, otherwise we *could* theoretically end up compartmentalising printers and migrating off a lot of stuff to SE. Electronics, SE.Engineering, SE.Hardware Recommendations, etc. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The same applies to the **Misc/Anything 3D related**, in particular the [*Connecting 3D parts* question][10]. Yes, as some of the comments state, you could remove the 3D printer part and then it is basically an engineering question. However, when taken as a whole, this question *is* pertinent to 3D printing of large models, in parts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Also under **Misc/Anything 3D related**, Coding Ultimaker Cura *is* a SO type question, but it is *also* 3D printer specific&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Additional suggestions in the future&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of posting a new question, it *might* be a good idea to post an additional answer, containing the suggestion, to this question - in order to keep everything grouped together. This will save on the pain of having to go through all of the Meta questions as I have just done.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, that might mean that the suggestion request would not have such prominence that it would do if the suggestion was posted independently as its own question... So (at the risk of duplication), if a new question/suggestion is posted, then it could be a good idea to also copy that new post and add it as an answer below.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Meta Suggestions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are the meta questions that I used to create the categories above:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## [ask](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=ask) - 89 questions *in total*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###General scope questions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;

It is merely an attempt to offer one perspective of what has been suggested, and to ask &quot;How should we move forward?&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes it is a bit hard to see the wood for the trees...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Following on from tjb1's meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134/post-closing-issues, it seems like we should widen the scope and be less strict about what is, and what is not, on-topic. What do people think? What additions, if any, should be made? Are there things that definitely should be on the list, that aren't currently?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, with respect to our [On-topic page][1], which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking (&quot;why has my question been closed?&quot;/&quot;why is X not allowed&quot;),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words &quot;[ask][2]&quot; and &quot;[topic][3]&quot;. I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request. The full list is at the bottom of this post.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even though I went through both lists twice - also, I didn't read *every* question and answer listed below fully - *there may be some suggestions that I have missed*. Please feel free to either suggest a change, or edit this post directly and add any that have gone astray (in that respect, maybe this question should be a wiki?).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Whilst we maybe don't want to change the aim of the site too much (as doing so may put off some regular users), maybe the scope needs to broaden slightly, as to have a wider appeal and be more *inclusive*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Any thoughts, questions, additional suggestions that have not already been posted, agreements, or disagreements?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###TL;DR - Suggested topics&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the list below, &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Italics are used for notes&#xD;&#xA; - Strikethrough is used for definitive no-go topics&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Whilst there may be *some* overlap, duplication and/or mis-categorisation, the list of suggested on-topics seems to be, essentially:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;

WRT **Components**, and taking the [thermistors meta question][11] as an example, my first thought is that questions like this should remain, as they are pertinent to 3D Printing, otherwise we *could* theoretically end up compartmentalising printers and migrating off a lot of stuff to SE. Electronics, SE.Engineering, SE.Hardware Recommendations, etc. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The same applies to the **Misc/Anything 3D related**, in particular the [*Connecting 3D parts* question][10]. Yes, as some of the comments state, you could remove the 3D printer part and then it is basically an engineering question. However, when taken as a whole, this question *is* pertinent to 3D printing of large models, in parts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Also under **Misc/Anything 3D related**, Coding Ultimaker Cura *is* a SO type question, but it is *also* 3D printer specific&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Additional suggestions in the future&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of posting a new question, it *might* be a good idea to post an additional answer, containing the suggestion, to this question - in order to keep everything grouped together. This will save on the pain of having to go through all of the Meta questions as I have just done.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, that might mean that the suggestion request would not have such prominence that it would do if the suggestion was posted independently as its own question... So (at the risk of duplication), if a new question/suggestion is posted, then it could be a good idea to also copy that new post and add it as an answer below.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Meta Suggestions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are the meta questions that I used to create the categories above:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## [ask](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=ask) - 89 questions *in total*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###General scope questions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;

Kusalananda♦, a moderator there, posted [Editing questions&#xD;&#xA;&gt; recently put on hold (don't)][2]. The gist is something that I don't&#xD;&#xA;&gt; think is common knowledge, and it would be beneficial to apply the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; same logic here.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; It is common knowledge that editing an on-hold post automatically&#xD;&#xA;&gt; bumps it into the Reopen review queue. But there are two factors that&#xD;&#xA;&gt; may not be common knowledge:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt;  - That only happens within the first five days of closure.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  - It only happens once.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; There are a number of implications.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; 1. The five day limitation means that you can **time your minor edits** on closed posts so they don't unnecessarily force wasteful&#xD;&#xA;&gt; reviews. If you want to do tag cleanup or make minor English or&#xD;&#xA;&gt; formatting fixes that don't address the closure issue, wait until&#xD;&#xA;&gt; after the five days.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; 2. If you edit and fix the closure issue on a question closed more than five days, you need to **also vote to reopen** to get it into the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; queue.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; 3. The bumping happening only once was the impetus for Kusalananda♦'s post. If you edit the recently closed post to do minor polish that&#xD;&#xA;&gt; doesn't solve the closure issue, that bumps it to the Reopen review&#xD;&#xA;&gt; queue where it will waste a bunch of reviewers' time and won't result&#xD;&#xA;&gt; in it being reopened. But that also **uses up the one automatic&#xD;&#xA;&gt; bump**.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt;    Then, when the OP or another user actually fixes the post, that&#xD;&#xA;&gt; will not bump it into the review queue. Unless someone explicitly&#xD;&#xA;&gt; jump-starts the review process by voting to reopen the question (which&#xD;&#xA;&gt; typically isn't a requirement), the post will remain closed and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; potentially be deleted, even though it's been turned into an&#xD;&#xA;&gt; acceptable question.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; 4. If you are going to fix a recently closed question, make sure you **fix every issue**. Questions often have multiple problems and just one may be stated as the close reason. Review the question to identify&#xD;&#xA;&gt; everything that is a potential close reason, and address them all.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Otherwise, you might fix only one of the problems and the question&#xD;&#xA;&gt; will not be reopened due to the remaining problems. That puts it right&#xD;&#xA;&gt; back at point #3.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Bottom line**: if a question is recently closed, do not edit it until after the five days unless the edit will solve all closure&#xD;&#xA;&gt; issues.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://meta.superuser.com/questions/13646/editing-of-recently-closed-questions&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://unix.meta.stackexchange.com/q/5319/85417" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

The timeline:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Starting on July 1, users can [nominate themselves](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/election/1). Users can also ask questions on meta for potential moderators to answer. (Use the [meta-tag:discussion] and [meta-tag:election] tags.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* On July 8, if there are two or more candidates, we'll run an election. If not, I'll simply appoint the candidate. (There's a small chance we'll need to [remove a nomination](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/274114/lets-disallow-nominations-from-people-whove-been-suspended-in-the-past-year), but I doubt that will come up.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* If there is an election, I'll announce the results on meta on July 16. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Note for current moderators: there's no need to nominate yourself even though you'll likely get an email saying you should.

It is merely an attempt to offer one perspective of what has been suggested, and to ask &quot;How should we move forward?&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes it is a bit hard to see the wood for the trees...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Following on from tjb1's meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134/post-closing-issues, it seems like we should widen the scope and be less strict about what is, and what is not, on-topic. What do people think? What additions, if any, should be made? Are there things that definitely should be on the list, that aren't currently?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, with respect to our [On-topic page][1], which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking (&quot;why has my question been closed?&quot;/&quot;why is X not allowed&quot;),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words &quot;[ask][2]&quot; and &quot;[topic][3]&quot;. I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request. The full list is at the bottom of this post.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even though I went through both lists twice - also, I didn't read *every* question and answer listed below fully - *there may be some suggestions that I have missed*.

WRT **Components**, and taking the [thermistors meta question][12] as an example, my first thought is that questions like this should remain, as they are pertinent to 3D Printing, otherwise we *could* theoretically end up compartmentalising printers and migrating off a lot of stuff to SE. Electronics, SE.Engineering, SE.Hardware Recommendations, etc. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The same applies to the **Misc/Anything 3D related**, in particular the [*Connecting 3D parts* question][11]. Yes, as some of the comments state, you could remove the 3D printer part and then it is basically an engineering question. However, when taken as a whole, this question *is* pertinent to 3D printing of large models, in parts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Also under **Misc/Anything 3D related**, Coding Ultimaker Cura *is* a SO type question, but it is *also* 3D printer specific&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Additional suggestions in the future&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of posting a new question, it *might* be a good idea to post an additional answer, containing the suggestion, to this question - in order to keep everything grouped together.

What do people think? What additions, if any, should be made? Are there things that definitely should be on the list, that aren't currently?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, with respect to our [On-topic page][1], which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking (&quot;why has my question been closed?&quot;/&quot;why is X not allowed&quot;),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words &quot;[ask][2]&quot; and &quot;[topic][3]&quot;. I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request.

Electronics, SE.Engineering, SE.Hardware Recommendations, etc. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The same applies to the **Misc/Anything 3D related**, in particular the [*Connecting 3D parts* question][11]. Yes, as some of the comments state, you could remove the 3D printer part and then it is basically an engineering question. However, when taken as a whole, this question *is* pertinent to 3D printing of large models, in parts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Also under **Misc/Anything 3D related**, Coding Ultimaker Cura *is* a SO type question, but it is *also* 3D printer specific&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Additional suggestions in the future&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of posting a new question, it *might* be a good idea to post an additional answer, containing the suggestion, to this question - in order to keep everything grouped together.

Copyrights counterfeits and IP are ubiquitous in almost all things sold, so this is not a good candidate.

I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request.

Electronics, SE.Engineering, SE.Hardware Recommendations, etc. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The same applies to the **Misc/Anything 3D related**, in particular the [*Connecting 3D parts* question][12]. Yes, as some of the comments state, you could remove the 3D printer part and then it is basically an engineering question. However, when taken as a whole, this question *is* pertinent to 3D printing of large models, in parts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Also under **Misc/Anything 3D related**, Coding Ultimaker Cura *is* a SO type question, but it is *also* 3D printer specific&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Additional suggestions in the future&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of posting a new question, it *might* be a good idea to post an additional answer, containing the suggestion, to this question - in order to keep everything grouped together. This will save on the pain of having to go through all of the Meta questions as I have just done.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, that might mean that the suggestion request would not have such prominence that it would do if the suggestion was posted independently as its own question...

Some topics such as CNC, and Laser engraving, whilst are not 3D Printing, they share a lot of commonality. Where such questions are regarding such commonality then they ***may be*** considered to be on-topic. As always, all topics are subject to community discretion. For further explanation see [Game plan - What is on-topic?][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;7.

It is merely an attempt to offer one perspective of what has been suggested, and to ask &quot;How should we move forward?&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes it is a bit hard to see the wood for the trees...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Following on from tjb1's meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134/post-closing-issues, it seems like we should widen the scope and be less strict about what is, and what is not, on-topic. What do people think? What additions, if any, should be made? Are there things that definitely should be on the list, that aren't currently?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, with respect to our [On-topic page][1], which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking (&quot;why has my question been closed?&quot;/&quot;why is X not allowed&quot;),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words &quot;[ask][2]&quot; and &quot;[topic][3]&quot;. I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request.

Electronics, SE.Engineering, SE.Hardware Recommendations, etc. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The same applies to the **Misc/Anything 3D related**, in particular the [*Connecting 3D parts* question][12]. Yes, as some of the comments state, you could remove the 3D printer part and then it is basically an engineering question. However, when taken as a whole, this question *is* pertinent to 3D printing of large models, in parts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Also under **Misc/Anything 3D related**, Coding Ultimaker Cura *is* a SO type question, but it is *also* 3D printer specific&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Additional suggestions in the future&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of posting a new question, it *might* be a good idea to post an additional answer, containing the suggestion, to this question - in order to keep everything grouped together. This will save on the pain of having to go through all of the Meta questions as I have just done.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, that might mean that the suggestion request would not have such prominence that it would do if the suggestion was posted independently as its own question... So (at the risk of duplication), if a new question/suggestion is posted, then it could be a good idea to also copy that new post and add it as an answer below.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Meta Suggestions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are the meta questions that I used to create the categories above:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## [ask](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=ask) - 89 questions *in total*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###General scope questions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;

As *block quotes* for readability&#xD;&#xA;2. As *code formatting*, for ease of copy and paste (**C&amp;P &amp;#x2398;**)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are four sections:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [General Comments][8]&#xD;&#xA; - [Comments][9]&#xD;&#xA; - [Questions][10]&#xD;&#xA; - [Answers][11]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Note on shortcuts: *Magic links* and Relative paths&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is possible to reduce the length of the comments, so that they fit, by using *shortcuts*. Note that the `[help]`, `[ask]`, `[answer]` and `[about]` tags (in the C&amp;P) expand into *Help Center*, *How to Ask*, *How to Answer* and *Tour* links, respectively - so the entire URL does *not* need to be specified. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - `[help]`   =&gt; [help center][1]&#xD;&#xA; - `[ask]`    =&gt; [How to Ask][2]&#xD;&#xA; - `[answer]` =&gt; [How to Answer][3]&#xD;&#xA; - `[about]` =&gt; [tour][4]&#xD;&#xA; - `[tour]` =&gt; [tour][4]&#xD;&#xA; - `[chat]` =&gt; [3D Printing Chat][5]&#xD;&#xA; - `[edit]` =&gt; Edit the post link&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;N.B. `[tour]` and `[about]` are equivalent.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;See [comment formatting][6] for more information, or *better still*, see the [Complete list of help center magic links][7]. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also worthy of mention are *relative links*, so you can skip the *absolute URL* part (i.e. `https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com`).

What do people think? What additions, if any, should be made?

I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request.

Electronics, SE.Engineering, SE.Hardware Recommendations, etc. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The same applies to the **Misc/Anything 3D related**, in particular the [*Connecting 3D parts* question][12]. Yes, as some of the comments state, you could remove the 3D printer part and then it is basically an engineering question. However, when taken as a whole, this question *is* pertinent to 3D printing of large models, in parts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Also under **Misc/Anything 3D related**, Coding Ultimaker Cura *is* a SO type question, but it is *also* 3D printer specific&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###Additional suggestions in the future&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of posting a new question, it *might* be a good idea to post an additional answer, containing the suggestion, to this question - in order to keep everything grouped together. This will save on the pain of having to go through all of the Meta questions as I have just done.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, that might mean that the suggestion request would not have such prominence that it would do if the suggestion was posted independently as its own question... So (at the risk of duplication), if a new question/suggestion is posted, then it could be a good idea to also copy that new post and add it as an answer below.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Meta Suggestions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are the meta questions that I used to create the categories above:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## [ask](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=ask) - 89 questions *in total*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###General scope questions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;

Exceptions are the symbols for plane angular degrees, minutes, and seconds (°, ′, and ″), which are placed immediately after the number with no intervening space.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I must admit that *I* didn't realise that it applied to °C and %, as well... oops!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;--- &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In a **comment**, `&amp;nbsp;` does not work (nor does any HTML). Try `ALT+0160` - Or on Windows Ctrl+Shift+Spacebar (or on a Mac, type Option+Spacebar).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that it is best to stick with `&amp;nbsp;` in **answers** as the other options are ***impossible*** to see when editing - so the `&amp;nbsp;` serves as a nice visual clue.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://www.engadget.com/2010/12/16/32-gb-versus-32gb-almost-everyone-is-writing-it-wrong/?guccounter=1&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#General_rules" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

I left work for the day without clicking send on my comment, or my answer, and found today that it had closed, locked, and rejected. A comment said it should be rejected for being a hardware recommendation question.  Ultimately it was closed for being off topic.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;IMO, both of these reasons are incorrect, and miss the point of the question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Yes, the OP admitted that they were facing their conundrum because of a long delay from China, but the question was not about vendor A vs. vendor B.  The question was about what the requirements are for a motor in a particular application.  This was about specifications and parts selection, not, in the sense of I think it was intended, a product selection.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The OP wasn't asking about one 3D printer vs. another, or one system manufacturer vs. another.  The OP was asking which of two motors would be more suitable to the application.  This is engineering, not marketing.  This is education, not shilling a vendor.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for being &quot;off-topic&quot;, are we rejecting all questions about components and 3D printer engineering problems?  Have we become strictly a user group for off-the-shelf printing systems?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I feel strongly that this should be the place for discussing 3D printing engineering, and use, and tools.  But, perhaps this interest is unique to me, and I should find somewhere else to interact with 3D printing users who have engineering problems.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Have others noticed that the volume of reddit traffic related to 3D printing has dramatically increased in the last few months.  Has reddit become the preferred place for engineering questions?  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for the user who had the 3D Printing Beta door slammed in their face, IMO both options they presented were sub-optimal, and by closing the question we can't help them either with the choice, or with understanding why.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is a shame when a curious OP with a question that is real to them is rejected.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/11371/which-nema-17-stepper-motor-for-titan" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

On this carriage a build surface is attached where the printer prints the print on; it is always the top of the stack. Note that this can be e.g. a moving Y-axis&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or moving Z-axis carriage&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. In some cases the carriage is missing and there is just a static mounting, then it's a platform instead&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;. It is basically irrelevant if the build surface is glued to the stack or removeable in some way or another.&#xA;&#xA;Between the carriage and the build surface you can have have a stack of multiple elements: a structure or structures, a plate, plates or matts, insulation, etc. This **whole** assembly of elements make up the build platform, an example is shown below.&#xA;&#xA;[![Proposed build platform terminology][1]][1]&#xA;&#xA;Note that the linear support can be mounted in Y or Z direction. To tag the elements that make up the *build platform assembly*, a proposed solution can consist of the following terms for subassemblies:&#xA;&#xA; - [tag:z-axis] or [tag:y-axis] in combination with [tag:carriage], &#xA; - [tag:platform] (to support printers that have a solid platform, e.g. Hyrel/Delta)&#xA; - [tag:heated-bed] (aluminium bed or a silicone matt), which can have a &#xA; - [tag:glass-print-surface], [tag:pei-print-surface], [tag:buildtak-print-surface], etc. possibly augmented with the additional tag of [tag:removeable-print-surface] or [tag:magnetic-print-surface].&#xA;&#xA;## Annotations&#xA;&#xA; 1. The rails often take the shape of rods and bearings, linear rails&#xA;    of V-slot profile.&#xA; 2. Carthesian Portal or Cantilever printers &#xA; 3. CoreXY like the Hypercube  &#xA; 4.

SE 3D Printing is quite a small site and there aren't an awful lot of regulars here - but there are just enough who can give great answers, but not everyone ventures here, into meta. &#xA;&#xA;I think that you *should* ask the question, it does seem on-topic. If it is well presented (without typos) and has the necessary detail, then it should be OK.  It is usually only very poorly worded, poorly formatted and overly broad questions, where little thought and research has been done beforehand, which are shot down in flames... :-) &#xA;&#xA;Looking at your Reddit post, it seems ok, but it could be worth relevant quoting parts from those links that you listed (as links die over time and the information that you refer to could be lost), and show why or why not, *you* think certain options may or may not be suitable. Your question could also appear to be opinion-based or broad - so it could be better to narrow down your question to a point or two (or three).&#xA;&#xA;If it **does** end up getting closed, which hopefully it won't as you do appear to have put some thought into it, you will be provided with guidance as to how to edit and improve it and make it more suitable for StackExchange.&#xA;&#xA;I wouldn't worry too much, even the best of us have *bad post days* sometimes... it's not a big deal :-)&#xA;&#xA;Also, think about it this way, the time that you take formulating and crafting your question will be well spent as it should help clarify your question in your own mind. Often, I have found, whilst writing and clarifying a question, that I had actually mis-understood the whole issue in the first place, and sometimes re-working a post can help me find my own solution (especially when using peoples comments to adjust the original post), or at the very least, help me get my head around the issue.&#xA;&#xA;------&#xA;&#xA;### TL;DR - Don't over think this, just post your question :-)&#xA;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

This is a shame because some of them have interesting/informative answers. So this raises the question that whilst, yeah, close the obvious shopping answers, should the associated information/knowledge that resides in the answers be lost, or not displayed, because the question was auto-deleted? Is there a close-but-don't-delete flag?***&#xA;&#xA;---&#xA;&#xA;### Preamble&#xA;&#xA;*Admittedly, this is a bit of a slippery slope, and I certainly am **not** advocating that all closed questions get re-opened but I was going through [some of] the closed questions last night and it is a shame that a few were closed due to the narrow (maybe strict?) guide lines that were set initially. If I get time, I might add a new section to the meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/276, for new topics pulled from some select closed questions.*&#xA;&#xA;### Beachcombing the closed question pile&#xA;&#xA;I have been browsing a number of [closed questions][1] and came across a lot of &quot;Best first printer&quot; type questions, which are off-topic, admittedly, but they had some good answers. I think those sorts of questions get people to want to answer, for whatever reason (pride/emotion in demonstrating their own first printer, good/bad experiences, what have you...). Maybe, instead of closing *all* of them, it is worth having just one example question, such as the example below, so that it *has already* been asked - then we can legitimately close subsequent similar duplicates, without any loss of information or help.&#xA;&#xA;Taking this one as an example, https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/5836/whats-the-least-amount-of-money-i-can-spend-to-get-a-decent-printer. It was closed as being too broad. I actually voted to close it as well, although I'm starting to wish that I hadn't. It has some great answers in it and it is a shame that they have been lost.&#xA;&#xA;Since having been closed, it has now been *automatically deleted*. I'm just wondering whether it is worth undeleting it..?&#xA;&#xA;I am not 100% sure whether, after undeleting it, then leaving it closed will cause it to be automatically deleted again - isn't there some sort of *closed-but-don't-delete* flag? &#xA;&#xA;If there isn't then would it also have to be re-opened? Which, of course, entails other issues of &quot;Why do we allow certain broad questions to be left open?&quot; or &quot;It's a shopping question!&quot;&#xA;&#xA;Regardless, it *does* seem a shame to have lost those fine (but subjective) answers.&#xA;&#xA;### Summing up&#xA;&#xA;So, the point of this post is, should we save this information somewhere, and if so, in what format? I envisage a number of possibilities:&#xA;&#xA; - Blog post&#xA; - [Locked question][2]&#xA; - [Protected question][3]&#xA; - [Featured tagged question][4]&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;   (meta only?)&#xA; - [FAQ tagged question][5]&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; (meta only?)&#xA; - Closed, but not deleted, question - if this is possible&#xA; - A community wiki type post&#xA;&#xA;--------&#xA;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; See also [Difference between FAQ and Featured tagging][6]&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  [1]: https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/search?q=closed%3Ayes&#xA;  [2]: https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/22228/what-is-a-locked-post&#xA;  [3]: https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/52764/what-is-a-protected-question&#xA;  [4]: https://meta.stackexchange.com/tags/featured/info&#xA;  [5]: https://meta.stackexchange.com/tags/faq/info&#xA;  [6]: https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/133704/what-is-the-difference-between-the-per-site-metas-faq-and-featured-tags" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

It is merely an attempt to offer one perspective of what has been suggested, and to ask &quot;How should we move forward?&quot;*&#xA;&#xA;-----&#xA;&#xA;Sometimes it is a bit hard to see the wood for the trees...&#xA;&#xA;Following on from tjb1's meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134/post-closing-issues, it seems like we should widen the scope and be less strict about what is, and what is not, on-topic. What do people think? What additions, if any, should be made? Are there things that definitely should be on the list, that aren't currently?&#xA;&#xA;So, with respect to our [On-topic page][1], which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking (&quot;why has my question been closed?&quot;/&quot;why is X not allowed&quot;),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words &quot;[ask][2]&quot; and &quot;[topic][3]&quot;. I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. &#xA;&#xA;A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request.

Electronics, SE.Engineering, SE.Hardware Recommendations, etc. &#xA;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The same applies to the **Misc/Anything 3D related**, in particular the [*Connecting 3D parts* question][12]. Yes, as some of the comments state, you could remove the 3D printer part and then it is basically an engineering question. However, when taken as a whole, this question *is* pertinent to 3D printing of large models, in parts.&#xA;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Also under **Misc/Anything 3D related**, Coding Ultimaker Cura *is* a SO type question, but it is *also* 3D printer specific&#xA;&#xA;------&#xA;&#xA;### Additional suggestions in the future&#xA;&#xA;Instead of posting a new question, it *might* be a good idea to post an additional answer, containing the suggestion, to this question - in order to keep everything grouped together. This will save on the pain of having to go through all of the Meta questions as I have just done.&#xA;&#xA;However, that might mean that the suggestion request would not have such prominence that it would do if the suggestion was posted independently as its own question... So (at the risk of duplication), if a new question/suggestion is posted, then it could be a good idea to also copy that new post and add it as an answer below.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;------&#xA;&#xA;# Meta Suggestions&#xA;&#xA;These are the meta questions that I used to create the categories above:&#xA;&#xA;## [ask](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=ask) - 89 questions *in total*&#xA;&#xA;### General scope questions&#xA;&#xA;

Winter Bash is an annual event that can run on any Stack Exchange site that chooses to participate. Users have fun by earning “hats” for their gravatars by completing certain tasks (very similar to badges). We track everyone’s progress using hats in a leaderboard that looks similar to this:&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; [![hats][2]][2]&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; As always, we’re coming up with new hat designs for this year’s fun!&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; **The Details**&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; The event will run from 19 December 2016 up to and including 08 January 2017. Users will be able to see all the hats they’ve earned on http://winterbash2016.stackexchange.com. That site will also have a landing page, explaining the rules and other details of the event. &#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; Individual users who don’t want to participate, don’t want to see hats, and/or are generally anti-hat will have an “I hate hats” option available. And just like last time, at the end of the event, all hats will go back into storage. &#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt; The only visual change to the Stack Exchange sites themselves will be the presence of the hats and the “I hate hats” button in the footer.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;  [1]: http://stackpromos.com/promos/16/winter-bash-2015&#xA;  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/OohHZ.jpg" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

I personally find the structure of the StackExchange sites easy to navigate and appreciate the amount of moderation that goes into each site.&#xA;&#xA;# Search Engines #&#xA;Most traffic will most likely come from search engines (ie Google, Yahoo, etc.) which can find the questions/answers easiest from the use of Tags here on StackExchange.&#xA;&#xA;So, the first thing to keep in mind is ensuring the tags you use are plenty and accurate with each question you ask. This will help increase the chances of a search engine showing your question higher in its results list.&#xA;&#xA;Another factor, with regard to search engines, is the title of the question. Generally people are going to be more attracted to a specific question as they feel it will answer their question better. For example:&#xA;&#xA;***Extruder keeps jamming*** as a question title will probably not attract users to view the question as it is very vague.&#xA;&#xA;***MakerBot Replicator extruder jams with new filament*** as a question title is more specific and contains more &quot;keywords&quot; that a search engine can find. Obviously, this can also potentially deter certain users (say Ultimaker users), but the hope is that the tag system will help offset this issue.&#xA;&#xA;# Etiquette #&#xA;I agree with you in that I also find it difficult to &quot;advertise&quot; the 3D printing community on other websites. As it may be considered improper etiquette here on the StackExchange network to advertise or promote other websites, I wouldn't recommend &quot;advertising&quot; the community as a whole. However, if you notice, many answers on the StackExchange network include links to other forum or Q&amp;A sites (ie MSDN, CodeProject, etc.). With this in mind, I personally feel that it is appropriate to post links to specific questions here on the 3D Printing community on another site if it can benefit the users on the other site.&#xA;&#xA;If you are wanting to personally focus on bringing more traffic, you could participate on some of the forums you mentioned and try providing relevant links to this community. But, in the interest of maintaining quality on both websites, please remain respectful and courteous.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;----------&#xA;Hopefully this helps" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

For more information, see [Why are recommendations off-topic and where can I ask?](link to a meta post)&#xA;&#xA;You get the community to get support for the close reason, and a moderator implements it to allow questions to be closed. Bingo!&#xA;&#xA;However, you're going to need a meta post explaining why they are off-topic as well as other information. That's good etiquette: you don't leave users stranded and you continue to guide them to where they can ask a question.&#xA;&#xA;# 3.&#xA;&#xA;You do 1. first.&#xA;&#xA;Then, you allow such &quot;shopping&quot; questions to be on-topic, as long as they follow the specific criteria and answer all the questions that you have outlined in the meta post. Otherwise, you close it.&#xA;&#xA;Numerous sites do this. On Open Source, we allow questions that ask for the recommendation of an open source license. We have a meta post on what you need to include, as well as a dedicated close reason in case something is not of quality. It works very well.&#xA;&#xA;The only downside, is that it can take a bit of time and work to get right." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

PLA, ABS, PVA, etc.) which in FDM is usually the same as the print-material. However, in the case of machines like dual-extruders can be completely different. The print-material for the body of the part can be PLA while the support-material can be PVA. &#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt;Support-structure defines the &quot;style&quot; of structure that is generated by the slicer. For instance, I can have a scaffolding-like structure to support bridges and spire-like structure for small overhangs. Personally, I view infill as a subset of support-structure because it is material that is meant to support the overall body including ceilings. With infill I can have square, hexagonal, even cat-like styles of support structure.&#xA;&gt;&#xA;&gt;Trish - I agree on the structure being more about style (Trees, pylons, towers, included in the design or not, everywhere or not) while support material is more a subset of filament - PVA is one of those, but also one could use (in a dual extruder) ABS on a PLA print, and then remove the supports with acetone or some other stuff. One might use a super low melting filament and remove with heat." ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

It goes on to say:&#xA;&#xA;&gt; Although technically classed under the ThermoPlastic Elastomer&#xA;&gt; spectrum, the full name for TPU is ThermoPlastic Polyurethane. This&#xA;&gt; isn’t especially new in industry, but until recently wasn’t commonly&#xA;&gt; available in 3D printing.&#xA;&gt; &#xA;&gt; However recently it’s growing a lot more popularity among printers.&#xA;&gt; While on the surface very similar to TPE, but TPU 3D printing has some&#xA;&gt; notable differences.&#xA;&gt; &#xA;&gt; TPU is very similar in elasticity and other mechanical properties to&#xA;&gt; TPE. Although it is very slightly more rigid, at Shore 94A-95A. This&#xA;&gt; makes it a little easier to print in printers that don’t usually print&#xA;&gt; the original, softer TPE 3D printing filament well, as the slight more&#xA;&gt; rigidity is easier for the extruder mechanism to handle.&#xA;&#xA;So they don't seem ***exactly*** the same. I dunno, I'm not sure. However, we apparently have the tags already, so that isn't a major issue anymore. &#xA;&#xA;With regards to the synonym aspect: Are the questions going to to be the same, i.e. will the same issues happen to both TPU and TPE, or will TPU have special, particular issues? If the latter, then a synonym maybe isn't a good idea.&#xA;&#xA;Regarding [tag:flexible], I wonder if it is necessary. Aren't we trying to reduce the number of filament tags? See https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/59/fixing-the-filament-tags.

Text="I am pretty sure we all know the 3 types of 'never good' questions. The opinion based, the open ended and and the *list of questions in one question*. Of these, the third is usually curable. And we had the topic of purchasing [earlier][1].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But now I want to put attention on a different horse in the room. Purchasing questions. These come actually in quite some different styles!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. &quot;I want to buy X. Where to get it?&quot;&#xD;&#xA;2. &quot;I need a model to do X but for [insert reason here] can't make it myself. Is there a model of it?&quot;&#xD;&#xA;3. &quot;I wonder about X. Has anyone encountered X and can review it, so I can make an informed purchase?&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All these question cores can be called purchasing, but they are also different to some degree. Let's start from the least to the most concerning one:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Question 2 is more a &quot;LMGTFY&quot;. There is a clear best answer, as there might be a model around or someone might make the model for the person asking. Or convert an unprinted model into a printable one. It is somewhat OffTopic for being 3D-design in some instances, but it is OnTopic as we want a 3D printable rendition. So, no problems with these? A little: they often show little to no research effort.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Question 3 is a different kind of horse. Actually it looks more like a Mule than a horse. Well, that is, because it is actually an ass&lt;sup&gt;donkey&lt;/sup&gt;. It is not a purchasing question in so much as it is a review request. We had some review guidelines proposed when we last talked about purchasing questions, and they were a solid step, but we might - if this is still OnTopic after this discussion, make a separate meta for those. I deem the possibility of Reviews with a strict guideline OnTopic, as long as: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. All affiliations are made clear [e.g. is it a bought machine, review/send back machine or review/keep machine? Who's the sponsor? Just a watcher of this and that channel that reviewed the machine?] &#xD;&#xA; 2. They pass a Quality Control (however that may look like - guidelines are still to be made)&#xD;&#xA; 3. **They are not link-only answers.** One might put the full review in a video or link to several reviewers, but one should at least compile the pro/con of the video.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Question 1 is the big horse I have trouble seeing OnTopic here: they want a specific answer where to buy/get an object. Suggesting that one specific source might be better than any other would be inappropriate. But we might need to split the hair a little: There are *some* fringe cases where such a question is answerable, has a best answer and is not open ended when it comes to locating shops or makerspaces, that use the very same question setup (&quot;Is there a makerspace near X/Y/Z?&quot;) And there are questions that are what the RPG-Stack-Exchange calls &quot;Shopping &amp; Recommendation&quot;. They forbid to ask for a recommendation of a specific shop or item over another. We should adhere to that, unless it is one of these &quot;locate a real world place that does X&quot; cases. IMHO we shouldn't  answer to a question like &quot;What is a good first printer?&quot; or &quot;Is there a reputable CR-10 reseller?&quot; or others of these kind. Maybe the fringe case of &quot;Can I buy Printer X at the manufacturer?&quot; is ok too (as it is very specific!), but that is more a sourcing problem, not a purchasing question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, in fleshing out our community:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Where do we draw our lines what is In/Out regarding purchasing/acquisition questions? And, do we need to discuss review/sourcing questions?**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/179/another-approach-to-solving-purchase-questions" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Electronics, SE.Engineering, SE.Hardware Recommendations, etc. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The same applies to the **Misc/Anything 3D related**, in particular the [*Connecting 3D parts* question][12]. Yes, as some of the comments state, you could remove the 3D printer part and then it is basically an engineering question. However, when taken as a whole, this question *is* pertinent to 3D printing of large models, in parts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Also under **Misc/Anything 3D related**, Coding Ultimaker Cura *is* a SO type question, but it is *also* 3D printer specific&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Additional suggestions in the future&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of posting a new question, it *might* be a good idea to post an additional answer, containing the suggestion, to this question - in order to keep everything grouped together. This will save on the pain of having to go through all of the Meta questions as I have just done.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, that might mean that the suggestion request would not have such prominence that it would do if the suggestion was posted independently as its own question... So (at the risk of duplication), if a new question/suggestion is posted, then it could be a good idea to also copy that new post and add it as an answer below.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# Meta Suggestions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are the meta questions that I used to create the categories above:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## [ask](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=ask) - 89 questions *in total*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### General scope questions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;

It is merely an attempt to offer one perspective of what has been suggested, and to ask &quot;How should we move forward?&quot;*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sometimes it is a bit hard to see the wood for the trees...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Following on from tjb1's meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134/post-closing-issues, it seems like we should widen the scope and be less strict about what is, and what is not, on-topic. What do people think? What additions, if any, should be made? Are there things that definitely should be on the list, that aren't currently?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, with respect to our [On-topic page][1], which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking (&quot;why has my question been closed?&quot;/&quot;why is X not allowed&quot;),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words &quot;[ask][2]&quot; and &quot;[topic][3]&quot;. I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request. The full list is at the bottom of this post.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even though I went through both lists twice - also, I didn't read *every* question and answer listed below fully - *there may be some suggestions that I have missed*. Please feel free to either suggest a change, or edit this post directly and add any that have gone astray (in that respect, maybe this question should be a wiki?).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Whilst we maybe don't want to change the aim of the site too much (as doing so may put off some regular users), maybe the scope needs to broaden slightly, as to have a wider appeal and be more *inclusive*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;BTW, a useful post to read is [What should our documentation contain?][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Any thoughts, questions, additional suggestions that have not already been posted, agreements, or disagreements?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Update&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The list below was integrated into the on-topics page, on the 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; June 2019.

Electronics, SE.Engineering, SE.Hardware Recommendations, etc. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The same applies to the **Misc/Anything 3D related**, in particular the [*Connecting 3D parts* question][12]. Yes, as some of the comments state, you could remove the 3D printer part and then it is basically an engineering question. However, when taken as a whole, this question *is* pertinent to 3D printing of large models, in parts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Also under **Misc/Anything 3D related**, Coding Ultimaker Cura *is* a SO type question, but it is *also* 3D printer specific&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Additional suggestions in the future&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Instead of posting a new question, it *might* be a good idea to post an additional answer, containing the suggestion, to this question - in order to keep everything grouped together. This will save on the pain of having to go through all of the Meta questions as I have just done.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, that might mean that the suggestion request would not have such prominence that it would do if the suggestion was posted independently as its own question... So (at the risk of duplication), if a new question/suggestion is posted, then it could be a good idea to also copy that new post and add it as an answer below.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# Meta Suggestions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are the meta questions that I used to create the categories above:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## [ask](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=ask) - 89 questions *in total*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### General scope questions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;

[on-topic page][1] has been fixed up and made to look like the on-topic pages of other SE sites, rather than a jumbled beta mess (which was entirely my fault after my previous patch, I must admit). As we aren't really a *beta*-beta site any more (but rather more one of those perpetual beta sites) it seemed sensible to tidy it up.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, a recent [CAD question][2] raised some issues with the on-topic page, for not being particularly clear.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Obviously, it can still change a bit, and any suggestions or corrections will be *whole-heartedly* welcomed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Personally, I feel that the off-topic section doesn't seem prominent enough to me, but it has the same &quot;format&quot; as the other sites have. However, the other sites don't have such a massive list of on-topic as us - their on- and off-topic sections are *roughly* the same size, whereas our off-topic section is about 5 % the size of our on-topic section. Hence why the off-topic section seems to be invisible, stuck down right at the bottom.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, the only weird bit left now is the large block of waffly `&lt;sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;` text. Firstly, links don't seem to work within that block, for some reason, so I stripped them out. Secondly, some of the waffle needs to go.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Apart from that... &quot;Mission Accomplished&quot;?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Apologies to all that it took so long to fix up and prettify.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/15335/4762" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

[Generally used as an expedient way of getting rid of spam.](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/88994/what-is-the-difference-between-a-deleted-user-and-a-destroyed-user)&#xA;&#xA;⁴ This counts every review that was submitted (not skipped) - so the 2 suggested edits reviews needed to approve an edit would count as 2, the goal being to indicate the frequency of moderation actions. This also applies to flags, etc.&#xA;&#xA;⁵ Includes close flags (but *not* close or reopen votes).&#xA;&#xA;⁶ This ignores numerous deletions that happen automatically in response to some other action.&#xA;&#xA;⁷ This includes comments deleted by their own authors (which also account for some number of handled comment flags).   &#xA;   &#xA;### Further reading:&#xA;&#xA;- Wanna see how these numbers have changed over time?

[Generally used as an expedient way of getting rid of spam.](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/88994/what-is-the-difference-between-a-deleted-user-and-a-destroyed-user)&#xA;&#xA;⁴ This counts every review that was submitted (not skipped) - so the 2 suggested edits reviews needed to approve an edit would count as 2, the goal being to indicate the frequency of moderation actions. This also applies to flags, etc.&#xA;&#xA;⁵ Includes close flags (but *not* close or reopen votes).&#xA;&#xA;⁶ This ignores numerous deletions that happen automatically in response to some other action.&#xA;&#xA;⁷ This includes comments deleted by their own authors (which also account for some number of handled comment flags).   &#xA;   &#xA;### Further reading:&#xA;&#xA;- Wanna see how these numbers have changed over time?

Special [badges](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/badges) (Moderation Badges) are to be earned, e.g.&#xD;&#xA;- [Civic Duty] -&gt; Vote 300 or more times (awarded only 18 times to date!)&#xD;&#xA;- [Electorate] -&gt; Vote on 600 questions and 25% or more of total votes are on questions (awarded only 7 times to date!)&#xD;&#xA;- [Vox Populi] -&gt; Use the maximum 40 votes in a day (awarded only 29 times to date!)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If the question is from a new user and half decent we should vote up to reward the question so that the user is able to enter the chat. Similar for answers, I've seen answers that are good but still not receive the votes and attention the answer should receive. Voting doesn't cost anything. If you don't agree with an answer, you could also withhold your vote and only down vote if something is completely wrong.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I know that various members are already trying to limit the amount of comments and invite people to discuss further in chat.

1. A number of 10k+ users ( *n* &gt; 3 ) are required to access mod tools&#xD;&#xA; 2. A number of 3k+ users ( *n* &gt; 10 ) are required to be able to fully vote&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### The final hurdle&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The main sticking point, according to this meta post on Ethereum, [Congratulations! Ethereum is graduating!][5], is 10 questions per day, which we are a long way from, and seems to be the last remaining issue. A link ([Graduation, site closure, and a clearer outlook on the health of SE sites][6]) from the Ethereum meta post to Meta.SE states:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; When a site starts to consistently receive 10 questions/day, we’ll consider it for graduation. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### No graduation, but losing the Beta label...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Apart from graduation, SE management has recognised that small sites (with an active community) struggle to reach the 10 questions/day consistently. For sites that have been waiting to get out of Beta by graduation for 7-8 years, SE has decided to drop the Beta label.

1.

A link ([Graduation, site closure, and a clearer outlook on the health of SE sites][5]) from the Ethereum meta post to Meta.SE states:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; When a site starts to consistently receive 10 questions/day, we’ll consider it for graduation. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### No graduation, but losing the Beta label...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Apart from graduation, SE management has recognised that small sites (with an active community) struggle to reach the 10 questions/day consistently. For sites that have been waiting to get out of Beta by graduation for 7-8 years, SE has decided to drop the Beta label.

1. A number of 10k+ users ( *n* &gt; 3 ) are required to access mod tools&#xD;&#xA; 2. A number of 3k+ users ( *n* &gt; 10 ) are required to be able to fully vote&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### The final hurdle&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The main sticking point, according to this meta post on Ethereum, [Congratulations! Ethereum is graduating!][4], is 10 questions per day, which we are a long way from, and seems to be the last remaining issue. A link ([Graduation, site closure, and a clearer outlook on the health of SE sites][5]) from the Ethereum meta post to Meta.SE states:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; When a site starts to consistently receive 10 questions/day, we’ll consider it for graduation. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### No graduation, but losing the Beta label...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Apart from graduation, SE management has recognised that small sites (with an active community) struggle to reach the 10 questions/day consistently. For sites that have been waiting to get out of Beta by graduation for 7-8 years, SE has decided to drop the Beta label.

1. A number of 10k+ users ( *n* &gt; 3 ) are required to access mod tools&#xD;&#xA; 2. A number of 3k+ users ( *n* &gt; 10 ) are required to be able to fully vote&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### The final hurdle&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The main sticking point, according to this meta post on Ethereum, [Congratulations! Ethereum is graduating!][4], is 10 questions per day, which we are a long way from, and seems to be the last remaining issue. A link ([Graduation, site closure, and a clearer outlook on the health of SE sites][5]) from the Ethereum meta post to Meta.SE states:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; When a site starts to consistently receive 10 questions/day, we’ll consider it for graduation. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### No graduation, but losing the Beta label...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Apart from graduation, SE management has recognised that small sites (with an active community) struggle to reach the 10 questions/day consistently. For sites that have been waiting to get out of Beta by graduation for 7-8 years, SE has decided to drop the Beta label.

1.

A number of 3k+ users ( *n* &gt; 10 ) are required to be able to fully vote&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### The final hurdle&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The main sticking point, according to this meta post on Ethereum, [Congratulations! Ethereum is graduating!][6], is 10 questions per day, which we are a long way from, and seems to be the last remaining issue. A link ([Graduation, site closure, and a clearer outlook on the health of SE sites][7]) from the Ethereum meta post to Meta.SE states:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; When a site starts to consistently receive 10 questions/day, we’ll consider it for graduation. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### No graduation, but losing the Beta label...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Apart from graduation, SE management has recognised that small sites (with an active community) struggle to reach the 10 questions/day consistently. For sites that have been waiting to get out of Beta by graduation for 7-8 years, SE has decided to drop the Beta label.

Text="I've just noticed this Meta post, [Testing three-vote close and reopen on 13 network sites][1] and I wondered whether we should employ it here, and what do other people think?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We are a smallish site, with a smallish number of active users (although it isn't *that* small, and is slowly growing over time, it should be noted). We don't have a problem with review queues building up *except* with the close votes. Some questions do seem to hang around for a while in the close queue. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The problem with the close vote review queue requiring 5 votes when there is a *limited* number of active reviewers (where two of which are moderators) is this: If a moderator votes, then the question is automatically closed, even if there aren't 5 votes - if a moderator casts the first vote to close then the question is closed straight away, without waiting for another four votes - so the vote is not democratic, but instead, dictatorial in nature. As such, moderators tend to not vote, unless the question blatantly needs closing (i.e. spam, vulgarity, etc.). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are ways around this problem:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - sock puppets (moderators have a fake account to cast votes only in the review queue), or;&#xD;&#xA; - waiting for four votes and then a moderator casting the fifth vote (or waiting for three votes and then moderators agreeing (behind the scenes) to cast the final two votes, etc.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, these aren't ideal, and just shortening the queue might make things better. This need not be a permanent change, I guess, so if this site, for some reason, eventually exploded in popularity, the review queue *could* go back to five votes (but I'm not 100 % sure about that, see the SE.Meta post above to check).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So... should SE.3DP jump on the &quot;three votes to close&quot; train? Or are things OK as they are? What do other users think? *Please* leave a comment or answer. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To make things super simple, and if you don't have time to write a comment or answer, you can just vote on the **Yes** answer or the **No** answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### End of voting date&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To give this vote an end point, and not make it so opened-ended, I guess we should tally a &quot;final&quot; vote on the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; July 2021 - which is May 6 (trial start date) plus 45 days (length of trial) plus a little bit more. As we can't join the trial halfway through, there isn't much point to tallying up the votes before that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At that point Catija will be sent the results.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/364007/280335" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

1.

A link ([Graduation, site closure, and a clearer outlook on the health of SE sites][7]) from the Ethereum meta post to Meta.SE states:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; When a site starts to consistently receive 10 questions/day, we’ll consider it for graduation. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### No graduation, but losing the Beta label...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Apart from graduation, SE management has recognised that small sites (with an active community) struggle to reach the 10 questions/day consistently. For sites that have been waiting to get out of Beta by graduation for 7-8 years, SE has decided to drop the Beta label.

I know that this might seem a pain, but can you repost your question using the [Ask Question](/questions/ask) link at the top of the page? When you repost your new question, please feel free to refer back to this original question using the URL, seeing as it is the reason why you posted in the first place.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;## Answer in a comment&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Comments are not recommended for any of the following: [Answering a question or providing an alternate solution to an existing answer; instead, post an actual answer (or edit to expand an existing one)](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/comment). Feel free to post an answer instead. Thanks.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**C&amp;P &amp;#x2398;**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    Comments are not recommended for any of the following: [Answering a question or providing an alternate solution to an existing answer; instead, post an actual answer (or edit to expand an existing one)](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/comment);.

Comments are for helping to improve questions and answers, and are distracting, so we try to keep them to a minimum. All of this information can be edited into your question to make it easier for people to answer your question. If all of the information is contained in one block then people don't have to read all of the comments to discover all of the information. Once all of the information needed to answer the question is contained within it, the comments can be tidied &amp; deleted.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**C&amp;P &amp;#x2398;**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    It is better to [edit] your question to add information requested in comments, rather than adding more comments.

Hint, the answer is in the title. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However... whilst it is obvious (to most people) which flags apply to which answers - when those answers are really just comments and those answers that are just gibberish - I've never totally and fully understood the subtle difference between **Not an answer** and **Low quality answer**, with respect to the queues and the flags that the moderators see. This following post goes some way to explaining the difference. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*This is copied verbatim from [Please don't flag link-only answers as Very Low Quality][1]*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Lately I notice that many link-only (or link-mainly) answers are being&#xD;&#xA;&gt; flagged as Very Low Quality, so I am taking to meta to ask y'all to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; use the Not An Answer flag for link-only answer (LOA) posts instead.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; I realise that the phrase &quot;very low quality&quot; is incredibly vague and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; open to endless interpretation, but the flag called Very Low Quality&#xD;&#xA;&gt; is only to be used for posts which are incoherent and **not&#xD;&#xA;&gt; salvageable by editing**.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Now, it's true that most of [the posts we consider Not An Answer][2],&#xD;&#xA;&gt; such as answers thanking other answers, answers that say &quot;I have the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; same problem; have you solved it yet?&quot; and so on, are not salvageable&#xD;&#xA;&gt; by editing.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; But there is one category of Not An Answer post that is fairly likely&#xD;&#xA;&gt; to be salvageable by editing, and that is link-only answers. Many new&#xD;&#xA;&gt; users, when prompted by a comment, will go ahead and expand their&#xD;&#xA;&gt; answer to include details from a link, and other users might be able&#xD;&#xA;&gt; and willing to edit such posts into shape themselves (I do it pretty&#xD;&#xA;&gt; frequently). It's not always appropriate to edit link-only answers&#xD;&#xA;&gt; (for instance, there may be copyright issues if we reproduce material&#xD;&#xA;&gt; from outside sources) but quite often it is, and editing might&#xD;&#xA;&gt; sometimes even make them good, upvoteable answers.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Now, you may well be thinking at this point that I'm being pedantic.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Who cares what the flag is called as long as the post gets the correct&#xD;&#xA;&gt; treatment, right? The reason I care a lot about this is that the Very&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Low Quality flag has a really interesting &quot;feature&quot;, which is that any&#xD;&#xA;&gt; action, except deletion, that resolves such a flag cast on an answer&#xD;&#xA;&gt; as helpful, will automatically cast a downvote on that answer. And for&#xD;&#xA;&gt; some reason, editing a post flagged Very Low Quality resolves that&#xD;&#xA;&gt; flag as helpful (even though the flag is supposed to be raised on&#xD;&#xA;&gt; posts that are not salvageable by editing) (this includes when the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; author edits) (this isn't the case for Not An Answer flags, by the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; way). So on those not-infrequent occasions when I find an answer&#xD;&#xA;&gt; flagged Very Low Quality (link-only or not) that I want to fix by&#xD;&#xA;&gt; editing, I have to do one of these things to avoid it being&#xD;&#xA;&gt; automatically downvoted:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt;  - delete the post (resolves the flag as helpful), undelete it and edit it (if it was flaggable)&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  - decline the flag, and then edit the post (if the answer wasn't flaggable at all in my opinion)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; I don't mind doing that, but, sometimes I forget to do it and edit&#xD;&#xA;&gt; first and the post gets downvoted. Ugh. Or someone else edits the post&#xD;&#xA;&gt; first (probably the author, poor soul), and it gets downvoted. Ugh. Or&#xD;&#xA;&gt; another mod dismisses the flag as helpful without deleting it because,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; although it's relying quite heavily on a link (or for some other&#xD;&#xA;&gt; reason was understandably flagged) it's actually not a link-only&#xD;&#xA;&gt; answer* (or otherwise deleteable), and it gets downvoted. Ugh. Nothing&#xD;&#xA;&gt; removes those downvotes!&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; **In conclusion, please flag link-only answers as Not An Answer** (unless you can fix them yourself or the author has indicated that&#xD;&#xA;&gt; they will do so imminently).&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Why is a link-only answer not an answer?** See this Meta Stack Exchange post [Your answer is in another castle: when is an answer not&#xD;&#xA;&gt; an answer?][3] (ironically I'm relying totally on that link...)&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ---&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ***When is a link-only answer not Not An Answer, and what is a link-only answer anyway?**&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; A link-only answer is one that is not useful at all without the link.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Sometimes answers that are useful without the link(s) they contain are&#xD;&#xA;&gt; flagged, but should not be. For example, an answer that gives a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; *specific, relevant recommendation*, even if it's very short, and includes a link that gives a step-by-step procedure to follow that&#xD;&#xA;&gt; recommendation, is not a link-only answer, because it's still useful&#xD;&#xA;&gt; without the link. Such answers can very often be improved, of course,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; by adding some version of the step-by-step procedure.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; There are very rare occasions when a link-only answer is an answer and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; should not be flagged. Sometimes, the question asks for something&#xD;&#xA;&gt; which cannot practically be included in the post. For example:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &gt; I need a driver for this thingy I have&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &gt; There is a driver for your thingy `[in this repository](URL)`&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Well, some installation instructions would be good, but we can't put&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the driver itself in the post, so this type of answer should not&#xD;&#xA;&gt; generally be flagged or deleted (commenting or editing or downvoting&#xD;&#xA;&gt; may be appropriate though).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://meta.askubuntu.com/q/19430/348964&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://askubuntu.com/help/deleted-answers&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225370/your-answer-is-in-another-castle-when-is-an-answer-not-an-answer" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

We've got over 5000 visits per day of which 2000 are new visitors. In the meta post https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/264/what-does-it-take-to-get-out-of-beta-stage we've tried to explain the progress on the Beta stage. Apart from the minimum questions per day (10 questions per day metric) we're doing quite well for the classic criteria for graduation (note that the smaller SE sites have difficulties to comply to this requirement).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We've got a good understanding of what's [on-topic and what's not](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic).&#xD;&#xA;Most of our tags have detailed tag wiki excerpts, explaining how and why they should be used.&#xD;&#xA;Us Pro-Tempore Moderators are doing less work due to our active [users](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/users) (thank you!). What we still need to work on is [voting](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/users?tab=Voters&amp;filter=year), see https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/196/remember-to-vote.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## What graduation means&#xD;&#xA;There are several aspects to graduation. These used to be bundled together as an all-or-nothing thing, but they [aren't any more](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/303727/lets-break-up-with-graduation-and-remove-a-bunch-of-beta-labels). This means:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Losing the beta label (yes! 16th December 2021, give or take)&#xD;&#xA;   - &quot;Graduated&quot; on [our Area 51 page](https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/82438/3d-printing)&#xD;&#xA;   - Removing the “Site Stats” and “Help us grow this site!” boxes shown to anonymous users.&#xD;&#xA; - Moderator elections (2022 or 2023)&#xD;&#xA; - Migration paths, maybe, if we ask for them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But we won't have:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Increased reputation thresholds&#xD;&#xA; - [Custom site design](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/263905/design-independent-graduation-is-on-for-early-september) (but we might get minor customization)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## How we can prepare&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you think we shouldn't graduate, for whatever reason, please say so: there's still time to slam on the brakes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Otherwise, we don't really need to do anything. If you want to, though, here are some ideas:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Write tag wiki excerpts for every single [tag](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/tags). I think this is achievable, even for weird tags like [tag:support], [tag:dimensional-accuracy] and [tag:chamber] to name a few.&#xD;&#xA; - Write some basic ([tag:knowledgebase]) Q&amp;A pairs, or edit/tag existing questions into such. (New-ish users: you're the best for this. If you have had a question about how the site works, chances are it's FAQ-worthy.)&#xD;&#xA; - Answer some [unanswered questions](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/unanswered) or vote to close if appropriate.&#xD;&#xA; - Start thinking of questions for our first moderator election. Also consider who you might want to nominate, and whether you might want to nominate yourself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Lastly, visit our [public 3D printing chat room](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/79830/public-3d-printing-room) for some on- and off-topic conversations!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Below is a breakdown of moderation actions performed on 3D Printing over the past 12 months:&#xA;   &#xA;|                  Action                  | Moderators | Community¹ |&#xD;&#xA;|:-----------------------------------------|-----------:|-----------:|&#xD;&#xA;| Users suspended²                         |          0 |         14 |&#xD;&#xA;| Users destroyed³                         |         67 |          0 |&#xD;&#xA;| Users deleted                            |          1 |          0 |&#xD;&#xA;| Tasks reviewed⁴: Suggested Edit queue    |        271 |        263 |&#xD;&#xA;| Tasks reviewed⁴: Reopen Vote queue       |          9 |          6 |&#xD;&#xA;| Tasks reviewed⁴: Low Quality Posts queue |         63 |         16 |&#xD;&#xA;| Tasks reviewed⁴: Late Answer queue       |        173 |         38 |&#xD;&#xA;| Tasks reviewed⁴: First questions queue   |        111 |         36 |&#xD;&#xA;| Tasks reviewed⁴: First Post queue        |        484 |        161 |&#xD;&#xA;| Tasks reviewed⁴: First answers queue     |         84 |         41 |&#xD;&#xA;| Tasks reviewed⁴: Close Votes queue       |         76 |         90 |&#xD;&#xA;| Tags merged                              |          1 |          0 |&#xD;&#xA;| Tag synonyms proposed                    |          2 |          0 |&#xD;&#xA;| Questions unprotected                    |          1 |          0 |&#xD;&#xA;| Questions reopened                       |         13 |          0 |&#xD;&#xA;| Questions protected                      |          7 |          8 |&#xD;&#xA;| Questions migrated                       |          4 |          0 |&#xD;&#xA;| Questions flagged⁵                       |         17 |        195 |&#xD;&#xA;| Questions closed                         |         94 |          1 |&#xD;&#xA;| Question flags handled⁵                  |        111 |        100 |&#xD;&#xA;| Posts undeleted                          |         20 |          7 |&#xD;&#xA;| Posts locked                             |          0 |         63 |&#xD;&#xA;| Posts deleted⁶                           |        173 |        258 |&#xD;&#xA;| Posts bumped                             |          0 |        409 |&#xD;&#xA;| Comments undeleted                       |         13 |          0 |&#xD;&#xA;| Comments flagged                         |        246 |         75 |&#xD;&#xA;| Comments deleted⁷                        |        752 |        170 |&#xD;&#xA;| Comment flags handled                    |        310 |         11 |&#xD;&#xA;| Answers flagged                          |         57 |        322 |&#xD;&#xA;| Answer flags handled                     |        319 |         60 |&#xD;&#xA;| All comments on a post moved to chat     |          2 |          0 |&#xA;   &#xA;### Footnotes&#xA;¹ &quot;Community&quot; here refers both to [the membership of 3D Printing](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/users) *without* [diamonds next to their names](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/users?tab=moderators), and to the automated systems otherwise known as [user #-1](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/users/-1).&#xA;&#xA;² The system will suspend users under three circumstances: when a user is recreated after being previously suspended, when a user is recreated after being destroyed for spam or abuse, and when a network-wide suspension is in effect on an account.&#xA;&#xA;³ A &quot;destroyed&quot; user is deleted along with all that they had posted: questions, answers, comments. [Generally used as an expedient way of getting rid of spam.](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/88994/what-is-the-difference-between-a-deleted-user-and-a-destroyed-user)&#xA;&#xA;⁴ This counts every review that was submitted (not skipped) - so the 2 suggested edits reviews needed to approve an edit would count as 2, the goal being to indicate the frequency of moderation actions. This also applies to flags, etc.&#xA;&#xA;⁵ Includes close flags (but *not* close or reopen votes).&#xA;&#xA;⁶ This ignores numerous deletions that happen automatically in response to some other action.&#xA;&#xA;⁷ This includes comments deleted by their own authors (which also account for some number of handled comment flags).   &#xA;   &#xA;### Further reading:&#xA;&#xA;- Wanna see how these numbers have changed over time?

But the good news is **you now officially only need 3 close votes to close a question on 3D Printing SE!**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;After looking at the data, I think it's clear that there's no reason for y'all to have this set at 5. Thank you so much for bearing with us while we got to this request.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We'll check back in with you all in a few months to see how things are going — if things are going great, we may not post an update but please feel free to leave a comment if you want us to post something.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here's some basic stats of how things look:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Over the last two years, you've had heavy fluctuations in effectiveness, when looking into what percentage of questions that received at least one flag or vote to close actually ended up getting closed. As you can see, the effectiveness is in the 60%~100% range — the good news is that the numbers of posts this represents are relatively small (always under 20 posts per month).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;!-- 28637 --&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![Graph showing the percentage of handled tasks, as described in the paragraph above][1]][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The graph below, however, does show something that is a bit more concerning:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;!-- 28653 --&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![Graph showing all closed posts, posts closed by the community, and posts closed by the moderation team. The line representing posts closed by the moderation team matches the line of all closed posts on almost all of the reporting period][2]][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This shows that the moderation team is doing the bulk of the closing, which can be problematic because the mods shouldn't be making these decisions on their own, even with other users weighing in. To add a bit more nuance, though, it looks like the moderation is not _single-handedly_ closing the posts, but rather stepping in to aid the community on a big chunk of cases — the graph below shows which vote the moderators cast, to close posts:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![Graph showing the amount of times mods cast the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th vote to close questions on the site][3]][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When working on this project, Catija had found two primary use cases for this change:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. When too many items are going unhandled (not unclosed, just unhandled)&#xD;&#xA;2. When the moderators are doing the bulk of the closing/reopening.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Because the mods here are casting the bulk of the final close votes, the first graph looks good (at least in the months where 100% effectiveness is reached). However, this creates an imbalance between closing and reopening as the mods now have to be really thoughtful about reviewing for reopening.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, my hope is that changing this to three votes to close/reopen will take some of the workload off the mods and also increase the number of posts that find their way to be reopened - assuming it's worth reopening them!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/iT5UH.png&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/922SP.png&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/6DeBm.png" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

This also applies to flags, etc.&#xA;&#xA;⁵ Includes close flags (but *not* close or reopen votes). Community can handle these flags by at least one person voting to close a question that has a close flag.&#xA;&#xA;⁶ This ignores numerous deletions that happen automatically in response to some other action.&#xA;&#xA;⁷ This includes comments deleted by their own authors (which also account for some number of handled comment flags).   &#xA;   &#xA;### Further reading:&#xA;&#xA;- Wanna see how these numbers have changed over time?

[Generally used as an expedient way of getting rid of spam.](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/88994/what-is-the-difference-between-a-deleted-user-and-a-destroyed-user)&#xA;&#xA;⁴ This counts every review that was submitted (not skipped) - so the 2 suggested edits reviews needed to approve an edit would count as 2, the goal being to indicate the frequency of moderation actions. This also applies to flags, etc.&#xA;&#xA;⁵ Includes close flags (but *not* close or reopen votes). Community can handle these flags by at least one person voting to close a question that has a close flag.&#xA;&#xA;⁶ This ignores numerous deletions that happen automatically in response to some other action.&#xA;&#xA;⁷ This includes comments deleted by their own authors (which also account for some number of handled comment flags).   &#xA;   &#xA;### Further reading:&#xA;&#xA;- Wanna see how these numbers have changed over time?

In fact I decided to remove quite a bit, and just leave in factual links and quotes.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;I came across this meta question over on SO today, [How can we determine whether an answer used ChatGPT?][1], and [this answer][2] in particular grabbed my attention: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I don't think there's going to be any value in having ***you***, a mere mortal, try to determine if an answer or question was generated by ChatGPT.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The reason is super, super simple: **we don't want this to turn into a witch hunt**.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; There are things you can do even today to help with curation of answers; if an answer is wrong or incomplete, you can downvote it. If you *happen* to notice a trend of similarly bad answers from an account, you can flag for moderator attention with the series of answers you've got as evidence.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; This shouldn't be a &quot;those bad answers are more moderatable than others&quot; situation - just vote on answers as you always would, and let the moderators deal with the heavier lifting on this circumstance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Which raises a valid point of allowing *suspicion and doubt* to get the better of us.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Yes, we have recently seen some questionable posts, and (to be frank) even now I am still not 100% convinced what the *root* cause of those posts were.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Nevertheless, community voting and flagging seem to allow us to handle such situations reasonably well. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, one thing that is certain: ChatGPT, and any other derivatives, are not going to go away, and it is probably going to become more and more difficult, as time goes by and the technology &quot;improves&quot;, to detect such posts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The tools that you used (and refer to in your question), while I haven't tried them myself, look useful - even though they themselves would *also* appear to be using some sort of artificial decision making! The best tools are probably our own eyes and knowledge to root out suspect sentences and phrasing as well as (more importantly) suspect advice. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In addition, a couple of answers (to the linked to meta SO question) also point out some good tips and what to look for - such as [this answer][3] and the first paragraph of [this answer][4], in particular.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/421880/4424636&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/421946/4424636&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/422561/4424636&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/422063/4424636" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

This site (with a narrower remit) took a *long* time to get out of Beta (see [What does it take to get out of Beta stage?][8]), and which was thankfully achieved, see [We're graduating!][9], due to the community successfully keeping the site centered around a 3D printing ethos.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/q/276/4762&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/q/413/4762&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/q/504/4762&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://area51.stackexchange.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/41850/digital-fabrication&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/22246/personal-manufacturing&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/q/264/4762&#xD;&#xA;  [9]: https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/q/534/4762" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

It is assumed that everyone here is trying to be helpful.*&quot; - I saw this quote on SO.&#xD;&#xA; - Removal of &quot;Thanks&quot; - this is both contentious and up-for-debate on some SE sites. However, if you agree with the above quote for &quot;Hope this helps&quot;, then the same can be applied to &quot;Thanks&quot; - it can be assumed that you will be grateful - also &quot;Thanks&quot; reduces the encyclopedia &quot;look&quot; of SE.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Correct use of SI units&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - SI units are the standard *(Imperial units can be used as secondary units but should be put in between parentheses after the SI units)*; &#xD;&#xA; - Adding non-breaking space before SI units (`&amp;nbsp;`) - see [Don't forget the space!][2];&#xD;&#xA; - Temperature units:&#xD;&#xA;   - Celsius: c or C or oC -&gt; &amp;deg;C (`&amp;deg;C`)&#xD;&#xA;   - Fahrenheit: f or F or oF -&gt; &amp;deg;F (`&amp;deg;F`)&#xD;&#xA; - Electrical units: &#xD;&#xA;   - Voltage: v -&gt; V; &#xD;&#xA;   - Current: a -&gt; A; &#xD;&#xA;   - Resistance: Ohms -&gt; &amp;Omega; (`&amp;Omega;`) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Presentation&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Break up walls of text, into more easily digestible paragraphs;&#xD;&#xA; - Replace slang, or *text-speak*, with grammatical English;&#xD;&#xA; - Possible re-arranging of text blocks, into a more logical, or clearer, sequence - if, for example, the post (usually an initially poor quality question) has slowly been built through a series of edits responding to repeated requests for additional information. However, care should be taken not to cause a conflict with the author's intent - respect the OP. &#xD;&#xA; - Remove instances of &quot;EDIT:&quot; and the such like (e.g. date and time stamps). There is already a link to the edit history of the post, which viewable by all, so there really is no need to replicate this in the text - it just disrupts the readability and flow of text.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Text formatting&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Removing HTML tags (i.e. `&lt;br&gt;`) when there is a markdown equivalent;&#xD;&#xA; - List formatting, and associated additional indenting of linked paragraphs and code;&#xD;&#xA; - Quotes must be *blockquote formatted* **and** have the source provided, preferably as a link. This is to avoid accusations of plagiarism and possible legal action.&#xD;&#xA; - Code formatting: G-codes should be *code formatted*, i.e. surrounded by backquotes (\`), indented by 4 spaces or (for multiple lines) enclosed by triple single backquotes (\`\`\`).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Images&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Image descriptions, *and* image hover tags;&#xD;&#xA; - Clickable image display - i.e. `[![&lt;imagedescription&gt;][x]][x]`, sometimes, somehow, the &quot;outside&quot; wrapper brackets get lost;&#xD;&#xA; - Orientation of image - requires a bit of &quot;manual&quot; labour in an image editor;&#xD;&#xA; - Appropriate size of image, crop out excess white border surrounds - requires a bit of &quot;manual&quot; labour in an image editor;&#xD;&#xA; - Ensure that the image has been added to the *Stack Exchange* imgur, rather than just the vanilla imgur, or an external site, as this reduces the chance of an image disappearing, due to [link-rot][3].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Inlining links&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Inlining links with the title of the linked page;&#xD;&#xA; - Inlining YouTube links with the title of video.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Title&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Don't forget to check the title, for spelling, etc., it can be easy to just focus on the body of the question, and overlook the title itself;&#xD;&#xA; - Title case should be replaced by regular case, i.e. &quot;This Is Very Ugly To Deal With&quot;;&#xD;&#xA; - Remove any information, already present in the tags, which is repeated in the title. For example, if the title is &quot;Filament - Is PETG more weather resistant than PLA?&quot;, the [tag:filament] tag can be used instead, and the redundant &quot;Filament&quot; can be removed from the title&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Information from comments&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Often there is a large amount of additional information in the comments beneath a post, in response to requests from other users. This additional information *really* should be in the post itself.  The comment should be copy/pasted into the post and tidied, if necessary. &#xD;&#xA; - Once the edit has been approved, the comment should then be flagged as &quot;It's no longer needed&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are probably more examples, so this list may get updated from time to time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Footnotes&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; I wrote this post as one central post doesn't seem to exist. There is a series of disparate meta posts (either on this meta, or other meta sites, or the main [SE.Meta][4] site), each dealing with one of the different facets of post editing, listed above, which I'll get around to posting links to. However, generally, it is by looking at other people's edits (across the various SE sites), that one gets an idea as to what should be fixed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Of course the [tag:PETG] and [tag:PLA] tags can also be used, but you wouldn't want to also remove *them* from the title as it would become meaningless..!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/14195/4762&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/q/297/4762&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://meta.stackexchange.com" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

It is assumed that everyone here is trying to be helpful.*&quot; - I saw this quote on SO.&#xD;&#xA; - Removal of &quot;Thanks&quot; - this is both contentious and up-for-debate on some SE sites. However, if you agree with the above quote for &quot;Hope this helps&quot;, then the same can be applied to &quot;Thanks&quot; - it can be assumed that you will be grateful - also &quot;Thanks&quot; reduces the encyclopedia &quot;look&quot; of SE.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Correct use of SI units&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - SI units are the standard *(Imperial units can be used as secondary units but should be put in between parentheses after the SI units)*; &#xD;&#xA; - Adding non-breaking space before SI units (`&amp;nbsp;`) - see [Don't forget the space!][2];&#xD;&#xA; - Temperature units:&#xD;&#xA;   - Celsius: c or C or oC -&gt; &amp;deg;C (`&amp;deg;C`)&#xD;&#xA;   - Fahrenheit: f or F or oF -&gt; &amp;deg;F (`&amp;deg;F`)&#xD;&#xA; - Electrical units: &#xD;&#xA;   - Voltage: v -&gt; V; &#xD;&#xA;   - Current: a -&gt; A; &#xD;&#xA;   - Resistance: Ohms -&gt; &amp;Omega; (`&amp;Omega;`) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Presentation&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Break up walls of text, into more easily digestible paragraphs;&#xD;&#xA; - Replace slang, or *text-speak*, with grammatical English;&#xD;&#xA; - Possible re-arranging of text blocks, into a more logical, or clearer, sequence - if, for example, the post (usually an initially poor quality question) has slowly been built through a series of edits responding to repeated requests for additional information. However, care should be taken not to cause a conflict with the author's intent - respect the OP. &#xD;&#xA; - Remove instances of &quot;EDIT:&quot; and the such like (e.g. date and time stamps). There is already a link to the edit history of the post, which viewable by all, so there really is no need to replicate this in the text - it just disrupts the readability and flow of text.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Text formatting&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Removing HTML tags (i.e. `&lt;br&gt;`) when there is a markdown equivalent;&#xD;&#xA; - List formatting, and associated additional indenting of linked paragraphs and code;&#xD;&#xA; - Quotes must be *blockquote formatted* **and** have the source provided, preferably as a link. This is to avoid accusations of plagiarism and possible legal action.&#xD;&#xA; - Code formatting: G-codes should be *code formatted*, i.e. surrounded by backquotes (\`), indented by 4 spaces or (for multiple lines) enclosed by triple single backquotes (\`\`\`).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Images&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Image descriptions, *and* image hover tags (see [this answer][3] for an example);&#xD;&#xA; - Clickable image display - i.e. `[![&lt;imagedescription&gt;][x]][x]`, sometimes, somehow, the &quot;outside&quot; wrapper brackets get lost;&#xD;&#xA; - Orientation of image - requires a bit of &quot;manual&quot; labour in an image editor;&#xD;&#xA; - Appropriate size of image, crop out excess white border surrounds - requires a bit of &quot;manual&quot; labour in an image editor;&#xD;&#xA; - Ensure that the image has been added to the *Stack Exchange* imgur, rather than just the vanilla imgur, or an external site, as this reduces the chance of an image disappearing, due to [link-rot][4].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Inlining links&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Inlining links with the title of the linked page;&#xD;&#xA; - Inlining YouTube links with the title of video.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Title&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Don't forget to check the title, for spelling, etc., it can be easy to just focus on the body of the question, and overlook the title itself;&#xD;&#xA; - Title case should be replaced by regular case, i.e. &quot;This Is Very Ugly To Deal With&quot;;&#xD;&#xA; - Remove any information, already present in the tags, which is repeated in the title. For example, if the title is &quot;Filament - Is PETG more weather resistant than PLA?&quot;, the [tag:filament] tag can be used instead, and the redundant &quot;Filament&quot; can be removed from the title&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Information from comments&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Often there is a large amount of additional information in the comments beneath a post, in response to requests from other users. This additional information *really* should be in the post itself.

There is a series of disparate meta posts (either on this meta, or other meta sites, or the main [SE.Meta][5] site), each dealing with one of the different facets of post editing, listed above, which I'll get around to posting links to. However, generally, it is by looking at other people's edits (across the various SE sites), that one gets an idea as to what should be fixed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Of course the [tag:PETG] and [tag:PLA] tags can also be used, but you wouldn't want to also remove *them* from the title as it would become meaningless..!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/14195/4762&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/q/297/4762&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/a/588/4762&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://meta.stackexchange.com" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Many sites use title statements rather than questions - to be honest, either seem acceptable, so just changing titles (of old questions) into grammatically correct interrogations seems unnecessary. You could do that for the new posts, as they aren't yet established - but if you are trying to look up an older question and the title has been changed, then that could be taken as &quot;making the post more confusing&quot;. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, there are *a lot* of question titles that aren't questions (but statements instead), and converting them *all* would mean a lot of suggested edit reviews - all for little to no gain.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Focusing on #5 for a moment, adding the &quot;Longer LK5 Pro&quot; to the title is *redundant* as the question is already tagged with [tag:longer-lk5]. Generally, when a question is tagged with &quot;*something*&quot;, that &quot;*something*&quot; is then *removed* from the title due to redundancy (see the section **Avoid putting tags in the question title** under [this answer][1] to [How do I make a good edit?][2]).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, your example #3 does seem useful as it does (admittedly) describe the issue better. That was one that I rejected, purely because (IIRC) it is an old question that already has an answer (that probably should have been accepted, had the user returned to the site after posting the question).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Actually, sticking with #3, the &quot;*with TMC2208 and Klipper*&quot; in the title should be removed as it is redundant, due to the tags (going by what was said above), which (by those rules) would leave the title as just:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Creality Sprite Extruder custom install on Ender 3 Pro&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;which *really* is *utterly meaningless*! LOL. :-) So, maybe the *part* of your suggested edit that includes the voltage is a very good idea - even though the answer then states that the voltages should be ignored - so something like this:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How to configure the TMC2208 Driver Voltage for a Creality Sprite Extruder custom install&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;and maybe tag with [tag:ender-3-pro], if there is one, otherwise the existing [tag:ender-3] tag might suffice..? However, I'm not sure how the Ender printers are meant to be tagged, and I might be wrong. There was a Meta post/discussion somewhere by Trish and/or 0scar about a possible hierarchy of tags, i.e. something *like* [tag:creality] and[tag:Ender] and then [tag:3], which I think was rejected - however, I've had a good look and really can't find the meta post.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, in summary, I would reject all of those edits again, apart from #3 as the title is a bit of a mess anyway - remove the redundant already tagged info from the title and mention the stepper driver voltages. If you suggest that edit, I'll accept it :-)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Suggestions&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As this is a small site (with little traffic, as discussed in your [previous meta post][3]), most of the questions have been edited to death already and as such, it can be difficult to find things to fix. It is probably best to stick to **new posts** that haven't yet been edited, or if an older post is blatantly incorrect and has been missed then that should be fixed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You might find this useful: https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/q/500/4762&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I notice that you've added some tags in other suggested edits. Many of these tags have no description, which can make it a bit harder to review the suggested edit, w.r.t the validity of the tag.  If you could edit such &quot;empty&quot; tags, with descriptions and usage, that would be *really* useful. In which case, these are related: &#xD;&#xA;- https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/q/565/4762&#xD;&#xA;- https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/q/116/4762&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;--- &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#### The problem with mods doing reviews&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As there really are *so few* regular users on the site, the review queues often fall to the moderators - otherwise they would never be cleared. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One issue with mods undertaking reviews, is that we are *unable* to vote as normal users, see [Add a way for moderators to cast a normal, non binding close/open vote][4]. That means that only one vote of ours is needed, which *seems* very undemocratic. I'm not happy about this, and would much prefer to have a community of votes, as is the usual case.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unfortunately, we don't have that luxury, and so some votes may seem autocratic in nature. However, as you have done, bringing up any perceived slight is always a good idea, and raising them here in Meta is always good for a discussion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/303220/4424636&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/303219/4424636&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/q/582/4762&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/41062/280335" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

Generally, it is much more simpler and efficient (and rapid) to just ask the poster to delete their question on the first site and just re-post it themselves on the new site.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A *very* similar question was asked recently on the Robotics Meta, please read [Can/should questions on Stack Overflow about ROS be migrated here?][1]. The [answer][2] seems to also apply to this site and (more or less) re-iterates what I said above.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, [this answer][3] to [Is &quot;Too old to migrate&quot; a good reason NOT to migrate?][4] is really useful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#### Other sites&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I looked at some of the [G-code questions on SO][5] and a number of them are related to simply programmatic issues, parsing issues or substitution, that don't have a 3D Printing end-game, and so they wouldn't be on-topic anyway.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The [Robotics site][6] was in a real lull until quite recently, when the [ROS (Q&amp;A) community was merged][7]. In the past some 3D printing questions *were* posted there, and I *did* think about getting those migrated, but then the OP had a meltdown and rage-quit, so that was the end of that.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The [Engineering site][8] also has some 3D design/modelling questions that *could* have fitted here, but (as has been [stated elsewhere][9]) it is OK for some overlap to exist between SE sites, a question might be suited to *more than one site* and it doesn't really matter where it lands - the question just gets slightly re-jigged for the appropriate audience.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Traffic&#xD;&#xA;There are graphs and spreadsheets and databases that can be queried to give you this sort of info. Early numbers can be seen in [this (now rather ramshackle) answer][10] to https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/q/264/4762.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also (vaguely) related are questions discussing participation:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/q/511/4762&#xD;&#xA;- more to be added as they are found...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#### A subjective view&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have had the (possibly unjustified) *feeling* that the site has tailed off since early 2022 or so (as I noted at the end of [this answer][11] to https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/q/556/4762).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;My *overall impression* is that this site was vibrant and had at least 10+ permanently active users, seven years ago, back in 2016. The questions back then seemed to be more related to:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- building DIY printers;&#xD;&#xA;- fixing Prusa printers and their clones;&#xD;&#xA;- filament queries;&#xD;&#xA;- general Arduino questions, and;&#xD;&#xA;-  firmware issues. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, 3D printing has become much more mainstream, in the past few years, there are many more reliable manufacturers of printers that (apparently) just &quot;work out of the box&quot; and less people are building from scratch. So, less questions... apart from the initial flurry of Creality support questions&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, when these printers first started to become popular (4-5 years ago?). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Nevertheless, even these types of questions seem to have tailed off, now, after a *subsequent* flurry of questions about Creality add-ons, such as the BLTouch (et al).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, w.r.t. repair, as 0scar states, most of the tinkering and repairing questions have already been asked and answered, back in the days of DIY printers. However, now and again a good old-fashioned board repair question comes along that you can get your teeth into, but they are becoming increasingly infrequent.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Nowadays, we *seem* to be down to a core of 4 or 5 regular visitors and  a few other less-regular users.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##### Chat room&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've just remembered that we also have a vibrant chat room (*two* in fact, see https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/q/307/4762), which were active in 2018 onwards, and (after having just checked) the [Public 3D Printing chatroom][12] still is. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Promotion&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There was the opportunity to advertise our site, using community ads, but I'm not sure what ever came of that. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;See:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/76/community-ads-lets-make-2d-ads-for-ourselves&#xD;&#xA;- https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/291/which-se-sites-should-we-target-with-community-ads&#xD;&#xA;- https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/q/384/4762&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, this question has (sort of) been asked before, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/q/74/4762&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Voting&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You *do* raise a good point: No votes makes it hard to *sort the wheat from the chaff*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Again, the voting (or apparent lack thereof) has been raised in the past, see:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- [How do we motivate users to vote and advertise the voting policy?][13]&#xD;&#xA;- https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/30/vote-early-vote-often&#xD;&#xA;- https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/196/remember-to-vote&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although, all of these seem to be from 2016.

It made me aware of the place. I made that question back then way before I had my own printer, but after a couple of material science classes that discussed pretty much the contents of the answer to the question and I tried to apply it to a hobby. It brought me to another hobby I would soon pick up: About christmas I bought my first printer, a TronXY X1. It was cheap, it was a tinker machine with a crazy wobbly gantry out of the box and I re-engineered [a gantry slider][2] for it that turned out to act like a spring on itself and keep the gantry with a little load and thus straight. It was a project in itself. In July 2018 I finally took my step to buy an Ender 3. The version 1, but not the very first production run. I started to look up trying to get an inductive probe running, so I figured out [voltage first][3], [then a setup][4], and came to a hiccup: I needed to update Firmware.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That firmware update sent me down the drain: I had never worked with firmware before, and half the answers were very cryptic to me as a beginner. But I sat down with Greenonline in chat and we went on a deep dive into what actually was the board in the machine I bought, and how to actually install firmware on it. It was a crazy few days for me, and I learned more between the bouts of feeling overwhelmed and seeing some success and waiting for an arduino to actually flash the firmware! It led to a flurry of questions: starting by [recalibrating][5], trying to [install hex firmware][6], [making my own hex file][7] for a modified firmware, and [flashing the board][8] before going full circle. Many of these questions would not be amiss on Adruino or Stack Overflow, but their context was always dealing with my printer. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Ender3 had just about as hefty a learning curve as dealing with the mechanical wobble of the TronXY X1 at first. But I had this community (and chat) as my support. Why was the learnign curve so hefty? Well, the initial V1 was not good. It was cheap, it had problems. [Like the Z-endstop is from the factory misaligned,][9] I ruinied [about 5 or such glue on surfaces][10], [Thermal Runaway PRotection wasn't flashed by default][11], the extriuder lever breaking could not be seen easily, leading me down to esoteric questions that to me now read like [&quot;Why the F... is my Layer height wrong?&quot;][12] and only some week after I noticed the break and got an aluminium replacement, firmware needed another upgrade to turn on [Power Loss recovery after the TRP upgrade did lack it][13] (though it never saw use - crazy stable power net here)...  I even started the [Knowledgebase tag][14] to make some of the most common-appearing questions easily findable. A Hotend swap required [a PID Tune][15] (which I only documented about a year later!)...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And then my Ender3 v1 broke as I moved it. The extruder stepper driver just fizzled. So I bought an Ender3 V2, put it together but out of the box swapped the extruder for the aluminium one, and... I kind of realized that I had no more questions that I either hadn't learned or asked about previously and that the Ender3 V2 was out of the box and much more user-friendly. It just... **worked**. Sure, it does not come with mesh bed leveling, its firmware isn't perfect, but it just worked.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3D printing had changed **so much** over the years since I started as a 3rd generation hobbyist (as in: 1st Gen was Reprap, 2nd gen was parts kits, 3rd gen is early (ca pre-2019) printers and now... we are way deep in Gen 4 or 5 printers that actively build on the problems of their predecessors. The tech is much more mature, and I am much more knowledgeable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## migration issue&#xD;&#xA;Now, my tale began with **one** migration. But that is an exception. We got a couple questions that were really ill fits. I helped to establish the benchmark test: &quot;Does the question claim that it's for 3D printing?&quot;. But often the questions have no clear target.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There's Blender, but most often that didn't fit. There's engineering, but often the question was not about either.

It is assumed that everyone here is trying to be helpful.*&quot; - I saw this quote on SO.&#xD;&#xA; - Removal of &quot;Thanks&quot; - this is both contentious and up-for-debate on some SE sites. However, if you agree with the above quote for &quot;Hope this helps&quot;, then the same can be applied to &quot;Thanks&quot; - it can be assumed that you will be grateful - also &quot;Thanks&quot; reduces the encyclopedia &quot;look&quot; of SE.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Correct use of SI units&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - SI units are the standard *(Imperial units can be used as secondary units but should be put in between parentheses after the SI units)*; &#xD;&#xA; - Adding non-breaking space before SI units (`&amp;nbsp;`) - see [Don't forget the space!][2];&#xD;&#xA; - Temperature units:&#xD;&#xA;   - Celsius: c or C or oC -&gt; &amp;deg;C (`&amp;nbsp;&amp;deg;C`)&#xD;&#xA;   - Fahrenheit: f or F or oF -&gt; &amp;deg;F (`&amp;nbsp;&amp;deg;F`)&#xD;&#xA;   - Kelvin: k -&gt; K (`&amp;nbsp;K`) [No degree sign!]&#xD;&#xA; - Electrical **units**: &#xD;&#xA;   - [Voltage][3]/Volt: v -&gt; V;&#xD;&#xA;   - [Current][4]/Ampere: a -&gt; A; &#xD;&#xA;   - [Resistance][5]: Ohms -&gt; &amp;Omega; (`&amp;Omega;`) &#xD;&#xA;   - [Power][6]: Watt -&gt; w -&gt; W&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Electrical science uses a set of nigh **universal variables** when writing down formulas:&#xD;&#xA;   - Voltage/Potential Difference: U/V&#xD;&#xA;   - Current/Flow: I&#xD;&#xA;   - Resistance: R&#xD;&#xA;   - Power: P&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Presentation&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Break up walls of text, into more easily digestible paragraphs;&#xD;&#xA; - Replace slang, or *text-speak*, with grammatical English;&#xD;&#xA; - Possible re-arranging of text blocks, into a more logical, or clearer, sequence - if, for example, the post (usually an initially poor quality question) has slowly been built through a series of edits responding to repeated requests for additional information. However, care should be taken not to cause a conflict with the author's intent - respect the OP. &#xD;&#xA; - Remove instances of &quot;EDIT:&quot; and the such like (e.g. date and time stamps). There is already a link to the edit history of the post, which viewable by all, so there really is no need to replicate this in the text - it just disrupts the readability and flow of text.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Text formatting&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Removing HTML tags (i.e. `&lt;br&gt;`) when there is a markdown equivalent;&#xD;&#xA; - List formatting, and associated additional indenting of linked paragraphs and code;&#xD;&#xA; - Quotes must be *blockquote formatted* **and** have the source provided, preferably as a link. This is to avoid accusations of plagiarism and possible legal action.&#xD;&#xA; - Code formatting: G-codes should be *code formatted*, i.e. surrounded by backquotes (\`), indented by 4 spaces or (for multiple lines) enclosed by triple single backquotes (\`\`\`).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Images&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Image descriptions, *and* image hover tags (see [this answer][7] for an example);&#xD;&#xA; - Clickable image display - i.e. `[![&lt;imagedescription&gt;][x]][x]`, sometimes, somehow, the &quot;outside&quot; wrapper brackets get lost;&#xD;&#xA; - Orientation of image - requires a bit of &quot;manual&quot; labour in an image editor;&#xD;&#xA; - Appropriate size of image, crop out excess white border surrounds - requires a bit of &quot;manual&quot; labour in an image editor;&#xD;&#xA; - Ensure that the image has been added to the *Stack Exchange* imgur, rather than just the vanilla imgur, or an external site, as this reduces the chance of an image disappearing, due to [link-rot][8].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Inlining links&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Inlining links with the title of the linked page;&#xD;&#xA; - Inlining YouTube links with the title of video.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Title&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Don't forget to check the title, for spelling, etc., it can be easy to just focus on the body of the question, and overlook the title itself;&#xD;&#xA; - Title case should be replaced by regular case, i.e. &quot;This Is Very Ugly To Deal With&quot;;&#xD;&#xA; - Remove any information, already present in the tags, which is repeated in the title. For example, if the title is &quot;Filament - Is PETG more weather resistant than PLA?&quot;, the [tag:filament] tag can be used instead, and the redundant &quot;Filament&quot; can be removed from the title&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Information from comments&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Often there is a large amount of additional information in the comments beneath a post, in response to requests from other users. This additional information *really* should be in the post itself.  The comment should be copy/pasted into the post and tidied, if necessary. &#xD;&#xA; - Once the edit has been approved, the comment should then be flagged as &quot;It's no longer needed&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are probably more examples, so this list may get updated from time to time.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;### Footnotes&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; I wrote this post as one central post doesn't seem to exist. There is a series of disparate meta posts (either on this meta, or other meta sites, or the main [SE.Meta][9] site), each dealing with one of the different facets of post editing, listed above, which I'll get around to posting links to. However, generally, it is by looking at other people's edits (across the various SE sites), that one gets an idea as to what should be fixed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Of course the [tag:PETG] and [tag:PLA] tags can also be used, but you wouldn't want to also remove *them* from the title as it would become meaningless..!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/14195/4762&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/q/297/4762&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/a/588/4762&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot&#xD;&#xA;  [9]: https://meta.stackexchange.com" ContentLicense="CC BY-SA 4.0" />

We don't have a specific way to share a whole STL file. I've often thought that we could do with a sharing mechanism similar to that used on the Blender site, which is blender-exchange.com. See [How to upload a blend file on BSE - good practices and advice](https://blender.meta.stackexchange.com/q/3050/14005) for more info about that. I'm not sure how one would go about creating an &quot;stl-exchange&quot; though. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, see [this comment](https://blender.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/3050/how-to-upload-a-blend-file-on-bse-good-practices-and-advice#comment6973_3050) and the [following comment][1]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I'd argue that 90-99% of uploaded files on Blend Exchange are a waste.

If you want to avoid seeing your edit blindly overwritten, first remove this comment. Rev.2 --&gt;&#xA;It’s that time of the year again! As we wave goodbye to last year and welcome the new one, we have [a tradition of sharing moderation stats for the preceding calendar year](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=&quot;year+in+moderation&quot;+is%3Aquestion).&#xA;&#xA;As most of you here might be aware, sites on the Stack Exchange network are moderated somewhat differently to other sites on the web:&#xA;&#xA;&gt; We designed the Stack Exchange network engine to be mostly self-regulating, in that we amortize the overall moderation cost of the system across thousands of teeny-tiny slices of effort contributed by regular, everyday users.  &#xA;&gt; -- [A Theory of Moderation](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/)&#xA;&#xA;That doesn't eliminate the need for having [moderators](https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/11/21/our-theory-of-moderation-re-visited/) altogether, but it does mean that the bulk of moderation work is carried out by regular folks — folks like you. Every bit of time and effort y'all contribute to the site gives you access to more privileges you can use to help in this effort, all of which produce a cumulative effect that makes a big difference in ensuring Stack Exchange sites remain a valuable source of high-quality content on the web.&#xA;&#xA;So as we say goodbye to 2023 (and January 2024… ahem) and move into 2024, let us look back at what we accomplished as a community... by looking at some [_exciting_ stats](https://i.stack.imgur.com/pmN7M.gif).

The community² can handle these flags by at least one person voting to close a question that has a close flag.&#xA;&#xA;⁷ This ignores numerous deletions that happen automatically in response to some other action.&#xA;&#xA;⁸ This includes comments deleted by their own authors (which also account for some number of handled comment flags).   &#xA;   &#xA;### Further reading:&#xA;&#xA;- Wanna see how these numbers have changed over time?

However, is there really no difference between [tag:slicer] and [tag:slicing]? I can't think of any differences, off the top of my head - unless the former is about the software and the latter is the process. I see that [tag:slicer] has no tag info, defining how the tag is *meant* to be used, whereas [tag:slicing] *does* have a clear tag usage. &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; More importantly, leading on from that, are the tagged questions themselves tagged &quot;correctly&quot;?&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Do the questions in the two tag groups have different leanings, i.e. those tagged [tag:slicing] are more process oriented and those tagged [tag:slicer] are more software oriented?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#### At first look&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As stated in the question, there are currently 204 [tag:slicing] questions and 6 [tag:slicer] questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The missing tag info for [tag:slicer] is easy to add - anyone can do so. I don't know why it wasn't added when the tag was added (more about this below, see **Further Analysis**).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Whilst having two tags *seems* to make sense, the questions should be checked to see that they have been tagged correctly (i.e. software or process oriented).

Currently, I have asked just two questions on this site. This one I have asked on January 23. The other, currently deleted question, I have asked on February 13. Both the questions were closed as opinion-based. Then, I have keep on making new edits until I get a question that is good for this site. Now, in my latest edit to the other question, I try to add sourced content to clarify, but the community marks it as spam and offensive, and deletes and protects the question. So, I need to edit both the questions to make it answerable for the site. So, I have requested for an appeal here. I really cannot live without a question with the original date as February 13. Look at Facebook. When I post something on Facebook, I can change the date and time of that post to an earlier date or time. I wish that StackExchange would have a similar feature. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What is something more specific I can ask about personalized medicine and consumers?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I really need to edit both the questions into practicable answerable questions.

However, is there really no difference between [tag:slicer] and [tag:slicing]? I can't think of any differences, off the top of my head - unless the former is about the software and the latter is the process. I see that [tag:slicer] has no tag info, defining how the tag is *meant* to be used, whereas [tag:slicing] *does* have a clear tag usage. &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; More importantly, leading on from that, are the tagged questions themselves tagged &quot;correctly&quot;?&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Do the questions in the two tag groups have different leanings, i.e. those tagged [tag:slicing] are more process oriented and those tagged [tag:slicer] are more software oriented?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#### At first look&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As stated in the question, there are currently 204 [tag:slicing] questions and 6 [tag:slicer] questions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The missing tag info for [tag:slicer] is easy to add - anyone can do so. I don't know why it wasn't added when the tag was added (more about this below, see **Further Analysis**).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Whilst having two tags *seems* to make sense, the questions should be checked to see that they have been tagged correctly (i.e. software or process oriented). This isn't an insurmountable task, although 204 is a bit of a chore. It's been done before, see the maker and model meta question, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/q/430/4762.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, if while checking whether the questions *have* been tagged correctly,  it then becomes a bit of a headache actually distinguishing the questions correctly - that is to say, determining whether [tag:slicing] or [tag:slicer] (or even both!) applies - then maybe, one *should* be the synonym of the other.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#### Further analysis&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Looking at the *dates* of the two groups of questions, it seems that [tag:slicer] is actually a (relatively) recent tag, presumably introduced in May 2021 with this question, https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/16372/4762 , which seems to be reasonable as the question is about Cura, rather than slicing, in general. However, I might be wrong in thinking this, I don't know - maybe [tag:slicing] would have still be sufficient tag for this question, in which case, the whole [tag:slicer] issue started with this question. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**However**, further checking reveals that [tag:slicer] was only added to *that* question, a month ago by [this edit](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/revisions/16372/3). So, really, this question could be retagged to [tag:slicing] without issue, as it has only had the (alleged) &quot;wrong&quot; tag for a few weeks.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That leaves 5 remaining [tag:slicer] questions, and then the next oldest question tagged [tag:slicer] is https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/21705/4762, which is where and when the [tag:slicer] tag was introduced - 30 Nov 2023 - so it *really* is a late addition. Interestingly, the same user edited the previous, older question to add the [tag:slicer].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Again, this question could be considered to be about *slicers* rather than *slicing*, but whether that merits having a new tag, that could *potentially* cause endless confusion, and mis-tagging, down the line.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt; The other four remaining questions were tagged as [tag:slicer] by their respective OPs, and while at least two of them (https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/21735/4762 and https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/22980/4762) could be considered correctly tagged as [tag:slicer], IMHO moving them to [tag:slicing] wouldn't harm the questions. The other two (https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/22846/4762 and https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/23008/4762) look to have been incorrectly tagged, and [tag:slicing] would be more appropriate.&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Update**: I have retagged these last four questions as [tag:slicing]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#### Was there a need for a new &quot;slicer&quot; tag?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would like to ask the OP, who introduced the [tag:slicer] tag, their reasoning for doing so, as well as:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Why no tag info was added for [tag:slicer], in order to distinguish its use from that of [tag:slicing]?&#xD;&#xA;- Was the existing [tag:slicing] deemed not to be appropriate, if so, why not?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would suggest that we wait for an answer/response to those questions, before we even consider blatting the [tag:slicer] tag (or creating a synonym).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There may be a legitimate reason to have a distinct tag, especially if there is a need and desire to separate *software* from *process*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#### Moving forward&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It may be decided by the community that a distinction *is* required and hence the need for two tags.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, if it is determined that there isn't a real need for a new tag, then we have two options:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- Create a synonym&#xD;&#xA;- Just re-tag the [tag:slicer] questions to [tag:slicing]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This latter option seems the easiest option and just returns everything to the way that they were prior to [tag:slicer] having been introduced.
